    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe purpose of these notes is to provide a comprehensive introduction to modern macroeconomics for Master’s students and researchers who may not be familiar with the field. Modern macroeconomics is characterized by the use of micro-founded behaviors of economic agents, such as households and firms, within dynamic environments. This analytical framework represents a significant departure from traditional models like IS-LM or AS-AD, which are typically studied at the undergraduate level. Given the substantial gap between undergraduate macroeconomics and more advanced, contemporary approaches, I deemed it necessary to prepare these notes. Additionally, this work is intended to facilitate my teaching responsibilities in the classroom.\nThese notes are organized around four main themes, which forms the building blocks of this document:\n\nA quick guide for methods in deterministic dynamics (Part I: Methods in Dynamic Economics), covering tools like ordinary differentials equations, difference equations and dynamic optimization\nAn overview of the benchmark model and their applications in growth theory (Part II: Benchmark models) presenting key models in dynamic macroeconomics. The Solow model introduces fundamental concepts in macrodynamics, while the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model (often referred to as the Ramsey model) and the Overlapping Generations model (OLG) are among the most widely utilized models.\nsome notes on Endogenous Growth Theory (Part III: Endogenous Growth Theory) summarizing major contributions in this area, ranging from the AK model to models of technological change.\nTopics in Aggregate Fluctuations (to be written).\n\nReaders should bear in mind that a model is primarily a tool for understanding real-world problems. Just as a tool can vary in its sharpness, a model can be more or less suited to studying a particular issue. Theoretical developments aim to refine these tools, while empirical methods assess their effectiveness in explaining different types of problems. In these notes, my goal is to provide students with a solid foundation for theoretical work in economics. The applications are potentially infinite (a major conclusion of Endogenous Growth Theory). Although additional applications may be incorporated over time, I believe this volume is already sufficiently comprehensive and beneficial to students in its current form. This is an initial version, and it is likely to evolve, incorporating new contents (topics, code blocks …) or revised structures within chapters.\nMany researchers and educators have contributed to the extensive literature on the topics covered here. While I have endeavored to write as accurately and originally as possible, I acknowledge that some formulations or sections may overlap with existing works. I apologize in advance for any such overlaps and will continue to refine this document until it reaches the desired standard. All errors are, of course, my own.",

    "text": "2.1 Definitions\nA differential equation is a mathematical equation derivend from an unknown function of one or more variables, which connects the function itself and its derivatives of various degrees.\nThe solution of a simple equation (or a system of equations) is a constant or a set of constants that satisfy these equations. In contrast, the solution of a differential equation (or a system of differential equations) is a function, or a set of functions that, along with their derivatives, satisfy the differential equation or the system of differential equations. The equations we shal consider are all functions of time \\(t\\), which is assumed to be a continuous variable defined on the set of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nConsider for a example the solution to the differential equation:1 \\[\n\\dot{y}(t)=\\frac{dy}{dt}=a\n\\] is a function \\(y(t)\\), the first derivative of which with respect to time is equal to \\(a\\). The general solution to this differential equation is the function\n\\[\ny(t)=at+c\n\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is an arbitrary constant. A particular solution can then be found using a boundary condition, such as an initial condition known at time \\(t=0\\), \\(y_0\\) taken as given.\nTo find the general solution, rewrite the initial equation as :\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\dot{y}(t)}{y(t)}=a \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{y(t)}\\frac{dy(t)}{dt}=a \\Rightarrow & \\frac{dy}{y}=a dt\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nWhich can be integrated:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\int \\frac{dy}{y}= \\int a dt +c \\Rightarrow ln(y(t))=at \\Rightarrow y(t)=c\\exp^{at}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwith \\(c\\) an arbitrary constant.To determine this constant and find the particular solution, use the information \\(y(0)=y_0\\) given:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\ny(0)=y_0=c\\exp^{a\\cdot0}\\Rightarrow c=y_0\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThe final solution has then the form:\n\\[\ny(t)=y_0exp^{at}\n\\] Note that we can differentiate with respect to \\(t\\) the RHS of the solution : \\(\\dot{y}(t)=ay_0 exp^{at} \\equiv a y(t)\\). We have indeed found the solution.\nWe could also look at a differential equation of the form \\(\\ddot{y}(t)=\\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2}=a\\) which is a second-order differential equation and so on …\nA solution of a differential equation is a function \\(y(t)\\), which along with its derivatives, satisfies the differential equation. A particular solution requires the determination of the arbitrary constant or a constants of integration.\nDifferential equations are classified by their porder, which is none other than the order of the highest derivative that appears in the equation.\nA differential equation is linear if the unknown function \\(y(t)\\) and its derivatives are linear. Otherwise, it is nonlinear.\nA differential equation can be solved by a method known as separation of variables if it can be written as a term that contains a function of only \\(y\\), equated to a term that contains a function only of \\(t\\). For example, \\(g(y(t))\\dot{y}(t)=f(t)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\ng(y)dy=f(t)dt\n\\] The solution can be found using the integration techniques used above.",

    "section": "2.2 First-Order Linear Differential Equations",
    "text": "2.2 First-Order Linear Differential Equations\nWe may found two types of linear differential equations: those with constant coefficients or those with variable coefficients.\n\n2.2.1 Constant Coefficients\nThis category of linear ODE takes the form:\n\\[\n\\dot{y}(t)+ay(t)=b\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nwith \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) some constants. To find the function that satisfies (2.1), note that\n\\[\\frac{d\\left(e^{a t} y(t)\\right)}{d t}=a e^{a t} y(t)+e^{a t} \\dot{y}(t)=e^{a t}[\\dot{y}(t)+a y(t)] \\tag{2.2}\\]\nIf the differential equation (2.1) is multiplied by \\(e^{a t}\\), its left-hand side is an exact differential equation) (i.e., the total differential of a function with respect to \\(t\\) ). The function \\(e^{a t}\\) is called the integrating factor. Multiplying both sides of (2.2) by \\(d t\\), we get\n\\[d\\left(e^{a t} y(t)\\right)=b e^{a t} d t\\]\nwhose integral is\n\\[e^{a t} y(t)=e^{a t} \\frac{b}{a}+c\\],\nwhere \\(c\\) is the constant of integration. Multiplying both sides of this expression by \\(e^{-a t}\\), we get\n\\[y(t)=\\frac{b}{a}+c e^{-a t} \\tag{2.3}\\]\nas the family of functions that satisfy the differential equation (2.1). This family is called the general solution of (2.1).\nTo determine the constant of integration \\(c\\), we need to know the value of the function at some point in time. For example, if we know that at time \\(t=0\\), \\(y(0)=y_{0}\\), then\n\\[y_{0}=\\frac{b}{a}+c\\]\nwhich implies\n\\[c=y_{0}-\\frac{b}{a}\\]\nThe general solution of the differential equation (2.1) that satisfies \\(y(0)=y_{0}\\) is then given by\n\\[\ny(t)=y_{0} e^{-a t}+\\left(1-e^{-a t}\\right) \\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{b}{a}+\\left(y_{0}-\\frac{b}{a}\\right) e^{-a t}\n\\]\nIn conclusion, to solve a linear first-order differential equation with constant coefficients, multiply it by the integrating factor and integrate it. To calculate the constant of integration, use the value of the function at some point. The point that is used is called an initial condition or a terminal condition, or more generally, a boundary condition.\n\n\n2.2.2 Variable Right-Hand Side\nIf the right-hand side of (2.1) is not constant but a known function of time, the solution method is similar. We multiply by the integrating factor and take the integral.\nFor example, for the differential equation\n\\[\n\\dot{y}(t)+a y(t)=b e^{\\lambda t}\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nmultiplying by the integrating factor and separating the variables results in\n\\[\nd\\left(e^{a t} y\\right)=b e^{(a+\\lambda) t} d t\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nTaking the integral of both sides of (2.5) yields\n\\[e^{a t} y(t)=\\frac{b}{a+\\lambda} e^{(a+\\lambda) t}+c\\]\nDividing both sides by the integrating factor, we get the solution\n\\[y(t)=\\frac{b}{a+\\lambda} e^{\\lambda t}+c e^{-a t} \\tag{2.6}\\]\nEquation (2.6) is the family of functions satisfying (2.4). The unknown constant \\(c\\) can again be determined by a boundary condition.\n\n\n2.2.3 Variable Coefficients\nThe general form of a first-order linear differential equation is\n\\[\\dot{y}(t)+a(t) y(t)=b(t) \\tag{2.7}\\]\nwhere \\(a(t)\\) and \\(b(t)\\) are known functions, and we seek the function \\(y(t)\\). The function \\(b(t)\\) is often called a forcing term and is considered exogenous. The integrating factor in this case is \\(e^{\\int a(t) d t}\\), because\n\\[\\frac{d\\left(y(t) e^{\\int a(t) d t}\\right)}{d t}=e^{\\int a(t) d t}[\\dot{y}(t)+a(t) y(t)]\\]\nThus, multiplying (2.7) by this integrating factor and taking the integral, we get\n\\[y(t) e^{\\int a(t) d t}=\\int b(t) e^{\\int a(t) d t} d t+c\\]\nDividing (C.21) by the integrating factor, we finally get\n\\[y(t)=e^{-\\int a(t) d t} \\int b(t) e^{\\int a(t) d t} d t+e^{-\\int a(t) d t} c \\tag{2.8}\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is the constant of integration. (2.8) is the general solution of (2.7). A particular solution requires a boundary condition that will determine the unknown constant \\(c\\).\nNote that it is not advisable to apply the solution (2.8) to any equation. It is simpler in many cases to multiply by the integrating factor and take the integral.\n\n\n2.2.4 Homogeneous and Nonhomogeneous Differential Equations\nIf \\(b=0\\) in (2.1), the differential equation to be solved is called homogeneous. Otherwise, it is called nonhomogeneous.\nThe general solution of a differential equation consists of the sum of the general solution to the relevant homogeneous differential equation (i.e., setting \\(b=0\\) and solving, and then adding to this solution a particular solution of the general equation (2.1).\nFor example, the homogeneous equation derived from (2.1) is\n\\[\\dot{y}(t)+a y(t)=0 \\tag{2.9}\\]\nThe general solution of (2.9) is\n\\[y(t)=c e^{-a t} \\tag{2.10}\\]\nA particular solution (setting, for example, \\(\\dot{y}(t)=0)\\) ) is\n\\[\\bar{y}=\\frac{b}{a} \\tag{2.11}\\]\nConsequently, the general solution of the nonhomogeneous differential equation (2.1) is the sum of (2.10) and (2.11), that is, the general solution of the relevant homogeneous differential equation (sometimes called the complementary function) plus the particular solution for a constant \\(y\\) (otherwise known as the particular integral). The general solution is thus given by\n\\[y(t)=\\frac{b}{a}+\\left(y_{0}-\\frac{b}{a}\\right) e^{-a t}\\]\nThis methodology is not generally necessary for solving first-order linear differential equations, but it becomes very useful for differential equations of order higher than one or for systems of first-order linear differential equations.\n\n\n2.2.5 Convergence and Stability of First-Order Differential Equations\nIn many economic applications, we are interested in the behavior of the solution of a differential equation as the independent variable, usually time, tends to infinity. The value to which the solution converges is referred to as a stationary state, or steady state, or equilibrium state.\nFor example, from (2.3), which is the general solution of (2.1), for \\(a&gt;\\) 0 , we get\n\\[\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} y(t)=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left(\\frac{b}{a}+c e^{-a t}\\right)=\\frac{b}{a} .\n\\]\nThe particular integral of the differential equation (2.1) can therefore be interpreted economically as the equilibrium state (or the steady state), which is the state toward which the variable \\(y\\) converges as time goes to infinity. This equilibrium is called a stable node. It is a stable equilibrium if \\(y\\) is a predetermined variable and only changes gradually, as postulated by the law of motion (C.26).\nAssume now that \\(a&lt;0\\). In this case, if the boundary condition \\(y_{0}\\) is different from the steady value \\(\\bar{y}\\), then \\(y(t)\\) (as determined by (C.26)) moves to plus or minus infinity, farther and farther away from the steady state. The only case in which this does not happen is when the boundary condition \\(y_{0}\\) is equal to the steady state value \\(\\bar{y}=b / a\\). Then \\(y\\) remains constant at \\(\\bar{y}\\). However, this is an unstable equilibrium, called a saddle point. There is only one adjustment path that leads to it and this is for \\(y\\) to jump immediately to the steady state. If \\(y\\) is a non-predetermined variable (for example, a financial variable or any variable that can change abruptly and not gradually), then it can jump immediately to its steady state value.",

    "text": "2.3 Second-Order Linear Differential Equations\nA second-order linear differential equation has the form\n\\[\\ddot{y}(t)+a(t) \\dot{y}(t)+b(t) y(t)=h(t) \\tag{2.12}\\]\nwhere \\(a(t), b(t)\\), and \\(h(t)\\) are known functions, and what is sought is the function \\(y(t)\\). The forcing term in this case is the function \\(h(t)\\). Equation (2.12) is referred to as the complete equation and is nonhomogenous. Related to (2.12) is a homogeneous differential equation in which \\(h(t)=0\\) :\n\\[\\ddot{y}(t)+a(t) \\dot{y}(t)+b(t) y(t)=0 \\tag{2.13}\\]\nwhich is called the reduced equation. The complete equation is nonhomogenous, whereas the reduced equation is homogeneous. The reduced equation is of interest because of the following two theorems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 1\n\n\n\nThe general solution of the complete equation (2.12) is the sum of any particular solution of the complete equation and the general solution of the reduced equation (2.13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 2\n\n\n\nAny solution \\(y(t)\\) of the reduced equation (2.13) on \\(t_{0} \\leq t \\leq t_{1}\\) can be expressed as a linear combination, \\(y(t)=c_{1} y_{1}(t)+c_{2} y_{2}(t), t_{0} \\leq t \\leq t_{1}\\), of any two particular solutions \\(y_{1}, y_{2}\\) that are linearly independent.\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Homogeneous Equations with Constant Coefficients\nWe first examine the differential equation (2.12), with constant coefficients, that is, \\(a(t)=a, b(t)=b\\). Assume that \\(h(t)=0\\). The differential equation then takes the form\n\\[\\ddot{y}(t)+a \\dot{y}(t)+b y(t)=0 \\tag{2.14}\\]\nInspired by the general solution of the first-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients, let us try the general solution\n\\[y(t)=c e^{r t}\\]\nwith unknown constants \\(c\\) and \\(r\\). This solution method is called the method of undetermined coefficients. This solution implies that\n\\[\\dot{y}(t)=r c e^{r t}, \\ddot{y}(t)=r^{2} c e^{r t}\\]\nSubstituting these expressions in (2.14), we get\n\\[c e^{r t}\\left(r^{2}+a r+b\\right)=0 \\tag{2.15}\\]\nFor a nonzero \\(c\\), our trial solution satisfies (2.15) only if \\(r\\) is a root of the quadratic equation\n\\[r^{2}+a r+b=0 \\tag{2.16}\\]\nEquation (2.16) is called the \\(characteristic equation\\) of (2.14). It has two roots:\n\\(r_{1}, r_{2}=\\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^{2}-4 b}}{2}\\).\nWe distinguish three cases, depending on the value of the discriminant \\(a^{2}-\\) \\(4 b\\) of the characteristic equation (2.16).\n\nCase 1 $ a^{2}&gt;4 b $ The discriminant is positive, and the roots are real and distinct. The general solution of (2.14) takes the form\n\n\\[y(t)=c_{1} e^{r_{1} t}+c_{2} e^{r_{2} t}\\]\nwhere \\(r_{1}, r_{2}\\) are the roots of the characteristic equation (2.16), and \\(c_{1}, c_{2}\\) are arbitrary constants.\n\nCase 2 $ a^{2}&lt;4 b$ The discriminant is negative, and the roots are a pair of complex conjugates:\n\n\\[r_{1}, r_{2}=-\\frac{a}{2} \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{4 b-a^{2}}}{2}=\\alpha \\pm i \\beta\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha=-\\frac{a}{2}\\), and \\(\\beta=\\frac{\\sqrt{4 b-a^{2}}}{2}\\). The general solution in this case is\n\\[y(t)=e^{\\alpha t}\\left(k_{1} \\cos \\beta t+k_{2} \\sin \\beta t\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(k_{1}, k_{2}\\) are arbitrary constants.\n\nCase 3 \\(a^{2}=4 b\\) The discriminant is equal to zero, and the two roots are the same and equal to \\(-a / 2\\). One can show that the general solution of (2.14) in this case takes the form\n\n\\[y(t)=c_{1} e^{r t}+c_{2} t e^{r t}=e^{r t}\\left(c_{1}+c_{2} t\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(r=-a / 2\\) is the double root of the characteristic equation (2.16), and \\(c_{1}, c_{2}\\) are arbitrary constants.\n\n\n2.3.2 Nonhomogeneous Equations with Constant Coefficients\nWe have already derived the solution of any homogeneous second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. To find the solution of a nonhomogeneous equation, we need a particular solution of the complete equation. If the complete equation is of the form\n\\[\\ddot{y}(t)+a \\dot{y}(t)+b y(t)=h\\]\nthen a particular solution is the constant function\n\\[\\bar{y}=\\frac{h}{b}\\]\nThe full solution is thus the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous equation plus the particular solution to the complete equation.\nFor differential equations with variable coefficients, more advanced methods, such as the method of variation of parameters, can be utilized for their solution.",

    "text": "2.4 A Pair of First-Order Linear Differential Equations\nWe next examine a case with extensive applications in macroeconomics: a pair of first-order linear differential equations of the form\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=a_{1} x(t)+b_{1} y(t)+p(t) \\\\\n& \\dot{y}(t)=a_{2} x(t)+b_{2} y(t)+g(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2.17}\\]\nwhere \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1}, b_{2}\\) are given constants, and \\(p(t), g(t)\\) are given functions. The solution of the system of differential equations (2.17) will be two functions \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) that satisfy both differential equations.\nThe homogeneous system that corresponds to (2.17) is given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{x}(t)=a_{1} x(t)+b_{1} y(t) \\\\\n\\dot{y}(t)=a_{2} x(t)+b_{2} y(t)\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{2.18}\\]\n\n2.4.1 The Method of Substitution\nOne solution method is the method of substitution. Substituting \\(y(t)\\) and its derivatives in the equation determining \\(x(t)\\), we end up with a second-order linear differential equation that contains only \\(x(t)\\) and its derivatives:\n\\[\\ddot{x}(t)-\\left(a_{1}+b_{2}\\right) \\dot{x}(t)+\\left(a_{1} b_{2}-b_{1} a_{2}\\right) x(t)=0 \\tag{2.19}\\]\nEquation (2.19) is a linear homogeneous second-order differential equation. It can be solved using the method of undetermined coefficients. Its characteristic equation is given by\n\\[r^{2}-\\left(a_{1}+b_{2}\\right) r+\\left(a_{1} b_{2}-a_{2} b_{1}\\right)=0 \\tag{2.20}\\]\nIf the roots of (2.20) are real and distinct, the solution of (2.19) is given by\n\\[x(t)=c_{1} e^{r_{1} t}+c_{2} e^{r_{2} t} \\tag{2.21}\\]\nSolving the first equation of (2.18) with respect to \\(y(t)\\), we get\n\\[y(t)=\\frac{1}{b_{1}}\\left(\\dot{x}(t)-a_{1} x(t)\\right)\\]\nSubstituting the solution (2.21) for \\(x(t)\\) and its first derivative, we get\n\\[y(t)=\\frac{1}{b_{1}}\\left(\\left(r_{1}-a_{1}\\right) c_{1} e^{r_{1} t}+\\left(r_{2}-a_{1}\\right) c_{2} e^{r_{2} t}\\right) \\tag{2.22}\\]\nConsequently, the solution of the system (2.18) consists of equations (2.21) and (2.22), if the roots of (2.20) are real and distinct. We can solve the system in an analogous way if we have complex or repeated roots.\nHowever, there is a second and more direct solution method of the homogeneous system (2.18). This method also generalizes to higher-order systems of differential equations.\n\n\n2.4.2 The Method of Eigenvalues\nOur experience with first-order differential equation suggests that we use the pair of equations\n\\[x(t)=A e^{r t}, y(t)=B e^{r t}\\]\nas particular solutions for (2.18). Here \\(A, B\\), and \\(r\\) are undetermined coefficients. Substituting these solutions in (2.18), we get\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nr A e^{r t}=a_{1} A e^{r t}+b_{1} B e^{r t} \\\\\nr B e^{r t}=a_{2} A e^{r t}+b_{2} B e^{r t}\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2.23}\\]\nDividing both equations by \\(e^{r t}\\), we can rewrite the system (2.23) in matrix form:\n\\[\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}a_{1}-r & b_{1} \\\\ a_{2} & b_{2}-r\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{A}{B}=\\binom{0}{0} \\tag{2.24}\\]\nFor (2.24) to hold, the determinant of the matrix of coefficients must be zero:\n\\[\\left|\\begin{array}{cc}a_{1}-r & b_{1} \\\\ a_{2} & b_{2}-r\\end{array}\\right|=0\\]\nCalculating the determinant, we get a quadratic equation in \\(r\\) :\n\\[r^{2}-\\left(a_{1}+b_{2}\\right) r+\\left(a_{1} b_{2}-a_{2} b_{1}\\right)=0 \\tag{2.25}\\]\nEquation (2.25) is the characteristic equation of the system (2.18). Equation (2.25) is identical to (2.20), the equation we ended up with when using the method of substitution. The solutions of the characteristic equation (2.25) are called the eigenvalues of the matrix of coefficients:\n\\[\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}a_{1} & b_{1} \\\\ a_{2} & b_{2}\\end{array}\\right)\\]\nThe two roots are given by\n\\[\nr_{1}, r_{2}=\\frac{\\left(a_{1}+b_{2}\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(a_{1}+b_{2}\\right)^{2}-4\\left(a_{1} b_{2}-a_{2} b_{1}\\right)}}{2}\n\\tag{2.26}\\]\nFor future use, note that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{1}+r_{2} & = & a_{1}+b_{2} \\\\\nr_{1} r_{2} & = & a_{1} b_{2}-a_{2} b_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf the roots are real, and \\(r_{1} \\neq r_{2}\\), then the general solution of the homogeneous system (2.18) is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x(t)=A_{1} e^{r_{1} t}+A_{2} e^{r_{2} t}, \\\\\n& y(t)=B_{1} e^{r_{1} t}+B_{2} e^{r_{2} t},\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A_{1}, A_{2}\\) are determined by boundary conditions; the roots are determined by (2.26); and \\(B_{1}, B_{2}\\) are determined by (2.23) as\n\\[B_{1}=\\frac{r_{1}-a_{1}}{b_{1}} A_{1}\\]\n\\[B_{2}=\\frac{r_{2}-a_{1}}{b_{1}} A_{2}\\]\nThe solution is identical to (2.21) and (2.22). In the case of complex or repeated roots, the solution is analogous.\nHaving found the general solution to the homogeneous system (2.18), it remains to find a particular solution of (2.17), using, for example, the method of variation of parameters.\nFor the special case where \\(p\\) and \\(g\\) are constants, a special solution with constant \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be found by solving the system of equations\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\na_{1} \\bar{x}+b_{1} \\bar{y}+p=0\\\\\na_{2} \\bar{x}+b_{2} \\bar{y}+g=0\\end{aligned} \\tag{2.27}\\]\nExpressing (2.27) in matrix form and solving for \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\), we get\n\\[\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}a_{1} & b_{1} \\\\ a_{2} & b_{2}\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{\\bar{x}}{\\bar{y}}=-\\binom{p}{g}\\]\nThe solution is then given by\n\\[\n\\binom{\\bar{x}}{\\bar{y}}=-\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\na_{1} & b_{1} \\\\\na_{2} & b_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right)^{-1}\\binom{p}{g}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\) can be regarded as steady state, or equilibrium points. Whether the system converges globally to equilibrium depends on whether both roots are real and smaller than zero. In this case, the equilibrium is a sink. If both variables are predetermined, this is a stable equilibrium.\nIf we have a positive and a negative root, the equilibrium is called a saddle point. There is only one unique path that leads to this equilibrium, and this path is called the saddle path. The economy will converge to equilibrium if one variable is predetermined and the other not predetermined. The non-predetermined variable will jump to the unique adjustment path leading to equilibrium. Technically, the negative root corresponds to the predetermined variable (for which we solve backward), and the positive root corresponds to the non-predetermined variable (for which we solve forward).\nThus, a system with one predetermined and one non-predetermined variable has an equilibrium (a saddle point) if the matrix of coefficients has one positive and one negative eigenvalue.\n\n\n2.4.3 A System of n First-Order Linear Differential Equations\nFinally, we turn to a more general case with extensive applications in macroeconomics: a system of \\(n\\) first-order linear differential equations of the form\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}_{1}(t)=a_{11} x_{1}(t)+a_{12} x_{2}(t)+\\cdots+a_{1 n} x_{n}(t)+g_{1}(t) \\\\\n& \\dot{x}_{2}(t)=a_{21} x_{1}(t)+a_{22} x_{2}(t)+\\cdots+a_{2 n} x_{n}(t)+g_{2}(t) \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\n& \\dot{x}_{n}(t)=a_{n 1} x_{1}(t)+a_{n 2} x_{2}(t)+\\cdots+a_{n n} x_{n}(t)+g_{n}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2.28}\\]\nwhere \\(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}, a_{i j}\\) for \\(i, j=1,2, \\ldots, n\\) are given constant parameters, and \\(g_{1}, g_{2}, \\ldots, g_{n}\\) are exogenous forcing functions of time.\nIn matrix form, this system can be written as\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\dot{x}_{1}(t) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\dot{x}_{n}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\na_{11} & \\ldots & a_{1 n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n 1} & \\cdots & a_{n n}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nx_{1}(t) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ng_{1}(t) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ng_{n}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nor\n\\[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\mathbf{A x}(t)+\\mathbf{g}(t) \\tag{2.29}\\]\nwhere bold letters denote vectors and matrices; \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the square \\(n \\times n\\) coefficient matrix, which is assumed to be nonsingular.\n\n\n2.4.4 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\nBefore we proceed to discuss the solution of the system of differential equations (2.28), it is worth delving a little more into linear algebra, and in particular, into the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nLet \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) be a square matrix, like the one multiplying the \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) vector in the righthand side of (2.29). An eigenvalue of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a number \\(\\rho\\), which when subtracted from each of the diagonal elements of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) converts \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) into a singular (i.e., noninvertible) matrix. Subtracting a scalar \\(\\rho\\) from each of the diagonal elements of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is equivalent to subtracting from \\(\\mathbf{A} \\rho\\) times the identity matrix I. Therefore, \\(\\rho\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) if and only if \\(\\mathbf{A}-\\rho \\mathbf{I}\\) is singular.\nBecause a matrix is singular if its determinant is equal to zero, \\(\\rho\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) if and only if\n\\(\\operatorname{det}|\\mathbf{A}-\\rho \\mathbf{I}|=0\\).\nFor an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{A}-\\rho \\mathbf{I}\\) is an \\(n\\) th-order polynomial in \\(\\rho\\), called the characteristic polynomial of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). An \\(n\\) th-order polynomial has at most \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, an \\(n \\times n\\) square matrix has at most \\(n\\) eigenvalues.\nIt follows from the above that the diagonal entries of a diagonal matrix \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) are eigenvalues of \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), and that a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is singular if and only if 0 is an eigenvalue of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\).\nRecall from elementary linear algebra that a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is nonsingular if and only if the only solution of \\(\\mathbf{B x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) is \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). Conversely, \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is singular if and only if the system \\(\\mathbf{B x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution.\nThe fact that \\(\\mathbf{A}-\\rho \\mathbf{I}\\) is singular when \\(\\rho\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) means that the system of equations \\((\\mathbf{A}-\\rho \\mathbf{I}) \\mathbf{v}=0\\) has a solution other than \\(\\mathbf{v}=0\\).\nWhen \\(\\rho\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) such that \\((\\mathbf{A}-\\rho \\mathbf{I}) \\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), is called a (right) eigenvector of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(\\rho\\).\nThus, eigenvectors are nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfy\n\\((\\mathbf{A}-\\rho \\mathbf{I}) \\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{A v}-\\rho \\mathbf{I v}=\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{A v}=\\rho \\mathbf{v}\\).\nThese three statements are equivalent.",

    "text": "2.5 Solving the \\(n\\) th-Order System of Linear Differential Equations\nLet us now turn to the solution of the \\(n\\) th-order system of linear differential equations represented by (2.28). The general solution of the nonhomogeneous system of differential equations (2.28) will be the sum of the general solution of the relevant homogeneous system of differential equations plus the particular solution for constant \\(x \\mathrm{~s}\\).\nWe shall concentrate on the solution of the homogeneous system\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\dot{x}_{1}(t) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\dot{x}_{n}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\na_{11} & \\ldots & a_{1 n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n 1} & \\cdots & a_{n n}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nx_{1}(t) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\tag{2.30}\\]\nor simply, \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A x}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is the column vector on the right-hand side of (2.30).\nAssume first that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a diagonal matrix, for which \\(a_{i j}=0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\). Then (2.30) becomes a system of n independent self-contained equations of the form\n\\[\\dot{x}_{i}(t)=a_{i i} x_{i}(t)\\]\nWe thus have a system of independent first-order linear differential equations that can be solved one by one:\n\\[x_{i}(t)=c_{i} e^{a_{i j} t}\\]\nIf the off-diagonal elements \\(a_{i j}\\) differ from zero, so that the equations are linked to each other, then we can use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix of (2.30) to transform it to a system of \\(n\\) (or fewer) independent equations. We can use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) to transform the system to a system that has a diagonal coefficient matrix.\nLet us assume that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has \\(n\\) distinct real eigenvalues \\(\\rho_{1}, \\rho_{2}, \\ldots, \\rho_{n}\\), with corresponding eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\mathbf{v}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_{n}\\). It then follows from the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A v}_{i}=\\rho_{i} \\mathbf{v}_{i}, i=1,2, \\ldots, n\n\\tag{2.31}\\]\nLet \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) be the \\(n \\times n\\) matrix whose columns are these \\(n\\) eigenvectors. Thus \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is defined as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P}=\\left[\\mathbf{v}_{1} \\cdots \\mathbf{v}_{n}\\right]\n\\tag{2.32}\\]\nThe system of equations (2.31) can thus be written as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A P}=\\mathbf{P J}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\\mathbf{J}=\\left(\\begin{array}{lll}\\rho_{1} & & 0 \\\\ & \\ddots & \\\\ 0 & & \\rho_{n}\\end{array}\\right)\\]\nBecause eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent, \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is nonsingular and therefore invertible. We can write\n\\[\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\mathbf{A P}=\\mathbf{J}\\]\nThus, we can use (2.32) to transform the system (2.28), defined in the variables \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), to a system in the variables \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}\\), which means that \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{P y}\\). It follows that\n\\[\\dot{\\mathbf{y}}=\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\mathbf{A x}=\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\mathbf{A P y}=\\mathbf{J y}\\]\nBecause \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) is a diagonal matrix, the solution of the system (C.59) can be obtained very easily as the vector of solutions to each variable \\(y_{i}\\) :\n\\(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}y_{1}(t) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{n}(t)\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}c_{1} e^{\\rho_{1} t} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_{n} e^{\\rho_{n} t}\\end{array}\\right)\\)\nFinally, we can use the transformation \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{P y}\\) to return to the original variables \\(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\) :\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}(t)=\\mathbf{P y}(t)=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\mathbf{v}_{1} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{v}_{n}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nc_{1} e^{\\rho_{1} t} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nc_{n} e^{\\rho_{n} t}\n\\end{array}\\right)=c_{1} e^{\\rho_{1} t} \\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2} e^{\\rho_{2} t} \\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\cdots+c_{n} e^{\\rho_{n} t} \\mathbf{v}_{n}\n\\]\nThus, under the assumption that the \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has \\(n\\) distinct real eigenvalues \\(\\rho_{1}, \\rho_{2}, \\ldots, \\rho_{n}\\), with corresponding eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\mathbf{v}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_{n}\\), the general solution of the homogeneous linear system (2.28) is given by\n\\(\\mathbf{x}(t)=c_{1} e^{\\rho_{1} t} \\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2} e^{\\rho_{2} t} \\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\cdots+c_{n} e^{\\rho_{n} t} \\mathbf{v}_{n}\\).\nThe solution in the cases of complex eigenvalues or multiple eigenvalues without enough eigenvectors is analogous to the solution of the second-order homogeneous system analyzed in Section 2.4.2\nSteady states and stability conditions are defined in an analogous way to those for first-and second-order differential equations. Assuming that the vector of \\(g \\mathrm{~s}\\) consists of constants, one gets the nonhomogeneous system:\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\dot{x}_{1}(t) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\dot{x}_{n}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\na_{11} & \\ldots & a_{1 n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n 1} & \\cdots & a_{n n}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nx_{1}(t) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ng_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ng_{n}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nThe steady state, if it exists, can be derived by setting the change in the \\(x \\mathrm{~s}\\) equal to zero. A steady state exists if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is nonsingular and is given by\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\bar{x}_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\bar{x}_{n}\n\\end{array}\\right)=-\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\na_{11} & \\ldots & a_{1 n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n 1} & \\cdots & a_{n n}\n\\end{array}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ng_{1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ng_{n}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{x}_{i}\\) denotes the steady state value of \\(x_{i}\\). These values can be regarded as equilibrium points. If the \\(x_{i} \\mathrm{~s}\\) are predetermined variables, for the system to converge to equilibrium, all eigenvalues must be less than zero. In this case, the equilibrium is a fixed node. When the \\(x_{i} \\mathrm{~s}\\) consist of \\(p\\) predetermined and \\(q\\) non-predetermined variables, where \\(p+q=n\\), the equilibrium (if it exists) is a saddle point. For the system to converge to equilibrium, there must be \\(p\\) negative eigenvalues and \\(q\\) positive eigenvalues. The negative eigenvalues correspond to the predetermined variables, which are solved for backward, and the positive eigenvalues correspond to the non-predetermined variables which are solved for forward.\nThus, a system with \\(p\\) predetermined and \\(q\\) non-predetermined variables has a stable equilibrium (a saddle vector) if the matrix of coefficients has \\(p\\) negative and \\(q\\) positive eigenvalues. The adjustment path is unique and is called a saddle path.",

    "text": "3.1 Lag Operators and Difference Equations\nTo define and analyze difference equations, it is useful to first define lag operators. The value of a variable \\(x\\) in period \\(t\\) is denoted by \\(x_{t}\\). The lag operator \\(L\\) for a variable \\(x_{t}\\) is defined by\n\\[L^{n} x_{t}=x_{t-n}\\]\nfor \\(n=\\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2, \\ldots\\)\nThus, the multiplication of \\(x_{t}\\) by \\(L\\) denotes the value of the variable in the previous period, and the multiplication of the variable by \\(L^{n}\\) denotes the value of the variable in period \\(t-n\\). Note than if \\(n\\) is negative (i.e., \\(n&lt;0\\) ), the lag operator shifts the variable \\(n\\) periods into the future.\nThis definition is mathematically somewhat loose. More formally, let us assume a sequence\n\\[\n\\left\\{x_{t}\\right\\}_{t=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\n\\]\nthat links a real number \\(x\\) with every integer \\(t\\). Applying the operator \\(L^{n}\\) to this sequence, we get a new sequence:\n\\[\n\\left\\{y_{t}\\right\\}_{t=-\\infty}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{x_{t-n}\\right\\}_{t=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\n\\]\nThe operator \\(L^{n}\\) projects one sequence onto another.\nLet us now examine a polynomial in the lag operator:\n\\[A(L)=a_{0}+a_{1} L+a_{2} L^{2}+\\cdots=\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} a_{j} L^{j}\\]\nApplying the polynomial \\(A(L)\\) to variable \\(x_{t}\\), we get a moving sum of \\(x \\mathrm{~s}\\) in different time periods:\n\\[A(L) x_{t}=\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} a_{j} L^{j} x_{t}=\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} a_{j} x_{t-j}\\]\nLet us confine ourselves to rational functions (i.e., polynomials) that can be expressed as the ratio of two finite polynomials in \\(L\\).

The combination of (3.1) and (3.2) imposes a more economical and restrictive form on \\(a_{j}\\), without serious loss of generality.\nA special case of (3.1) and (3.2) is the so-called geometric polynomial, which takes the form\n\\[A(L)=\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda L} \\tag{3.3}\\]\nFrom the properties of geometric progressions, the geometric polynomial can be expanded in two ways:\n\\[A(L)=\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda L}=1+\\lambda L+\\lambda^{2} L^{2}+\\cdots \\tag{3.4}\\]\n\\[A(L)=\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda L}=-\\frac{1}{\\lambda L}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\lambda} L^{-1}+\\frac{1}{\\lambda^{2}} L^{-2}+\\cdots\\right) \\tag{3.5}\\]\nThe expansion (3.4) is used when \\(|\\lambda|&lt;1\\), and the expansion (3.5) when \\(|\\lambda|&gt;\\) 1 .\nIf we multiply the geometric polynomial (3.3) by some variable \\(x_{t}\\), we get\n\\[A(L) x_{t}=\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda L} x_{t} \\tag{3.6}\\]\nWith the expansion (3.4) for \\(A(L)\\) we get\n\\[A(L) x_{t}=\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda L} x_{t}=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{i} L^{i} x_{t}=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{i} x_{t-i} \\tag{3.7}\\]\nIf \\(|\\lambda|&lt;1\\), and \\(\\left\\{x_{t}\\right\\}_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\) is a finite sequence of real numbers, then (3.7) defines a finite sequence of real numbers as well.\nIn contrast, we have the alternative expansion of (3.6). Using (3.5), we get\n\\[A(L) x_{t}=\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda L} x_{t}=(\\lambda L)^{-1} \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{-i} L^{-i} x_{t}=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{-i} x_{t+i} \\tag{3.8}\\]\nIf \\(|\\lambda|&gt;1\\), and \\(\\left\\{x_{t}\\right\\}_{t=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\) is a finite sequence of real numbers, then (3.8) defines a finite sequence of real numbers as well, because we have \\(\\left|\\lambda^{-1}\\right|&lt;1\\).\nIn economics, because we usually seek convergence to some equilibrium, we seek the analysis of finite sequences. Thus, we select the backward expansion when \\(|\\lambda|&lt;1\\), and the forward expansion when \\(|\\lambda|&gt;1\\).\nA difference equation (or recurrence relation) equates a polynomial in the various iterates of a variable-that is, in the values of the elements of a sequence-to zero.\nAn \\(n\\) th-order linear difference equation with constant coefficients takes the form\n\\[\na_{0} x_{t}+a_{1} x_{t-1}+a_{2} x_{t-2}+\\cdots+a_{n} x_{t-n}-b=\\sum_{j=0}^{n} a_{j} L^{j} x_{t}-b=0\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_{j}, j=0,1,2, \\ldots, n\\) and \\(b\\) are constant coefficients.\nBy equating the right-hand side of the geometric polynomial (3.7) to zero, we get\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{i} x_{t-i}=x_{t}+\\lambda x_{t-1}+\\lambda^{2} x_{t-2}+\\cdots=0\\]\nThis is an example of an infinite-order linear difference equation.",

In this case, to determine the two arbitrary constants \\(d_{1}\\) and \\(d_{2}\\), we need one initial and one final condition. The final condition can be none other than the equilibrium value.

We can use the second equation to substitute for \\(y_{t-1}\\) in the first equation, and thus obtain a second-order difference equation in \\(x\\) :\n\\[\nx_{t}=a+b x_{t-1}+c x_{t-2}\n\\tag{3.18}\\]\nwhere \\(a=\\left(a_{10}\\left(1-a_{22}\\right)+a_{12} a_{20}\\right), b=a_{11}+a_{22}\\), and \\(c=-\\left(a_{11} a_{22}-a_{12} a_{21}\\right)\\).\nEquation (3.18) has the same form as (3.14) and can be solved as an ordinary second-order linear difference equation with constant coefficients. Making use of the lag operator, the homogeneous equation corresponding to (3.18) can be written as\n\\[\n\\left(L^{2}-\\frac{a_{11}+a_{22}}{a_{11} a_{22}-a_{12} a_{21}} L+\\frac{1}{a_{11} a_{22}-a_{12} a_{21}}\\right) x_{t}=0 .\n\\]\nThe two roots of the polynomial in the lag operator must satisfy the characteristic equation\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-\\frac{a_{11}+a_{22}}{a_{11} a_{22}-a_{12} a_{21}} \\lambda+\\frac{1}{a_{11} a_{22}-a_{12} a_{21}}=0 \\tag{3.19}\\]\nBy going through the alternative substitutions, a similar second-order difference equation can be obtained for the second variable \\(y_{t}\\).\nAlternatively, one can rewrite the system (3.17) in matrix form as\n\\[\n\\binom{x_{t}}{y_{t}}=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22}\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{x_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}}+\\binom{a_{10}}{a_{20}}\n\\tag{3.20}\\]\nThe homogeneous system corresponding to (3.20), with \\(a_{10}=a_{20}=0\\), takes the form\n\\[\n\\binom{x_{t}}{y_{t}}=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22}\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{x_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}}\n\\tag{3.21}\\]\nUsing the lag operator \\(L\\), (3.20) can be rewritten as\n\\[\n\\binom{x_{t}}{y_{t}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1-a_{11} L & -a_{12} L \\\\ -a_{21} L & 1-a_{22} L\\end{array}\\right)=\\binom{0}{0}\n\\]\nFor (3.20) to have a solution, the matrix in the lag operator must be singular. Therefore, its determinant must be equal to zero. Thus, for a solution to exist, we must have\n\\[\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1-a_{11} L & -a_{12} L \\\\ -a_{21} L & 1-a_{22} L\\end{array}\\right)=0\\]\nThis condition implies a polynomial in the lag operator with characteristic equation\n\\[\n\\lambda^{2}-\\frac{a_{11}+a_{22}}{a_{11} a_{22}-a_{12} a_{21}} \\lambda+\\frac{1}{a_{11} a_{22}-a_{12} a_{21}}=0\n\\]\nwhich is identical to (3.19), the characteristic equation of the second-order difference equation (3.18), and will of course give the same solution for the two roots.\nHowever, even this solution method becomes unwieldy for higher-order systems when there are more than two variables. It is thus desirable to investigate other solution methods. To do so, it is worth generalizing the system to one of \\(n\\) first-order linear difference equations.",

Such systems arise quite often in dynamic macroeconomics:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{1, t}=a_{10}+a_{11} x_{1, t-1}+a_{12} x_{2, t-1}+\\cdots+a_{1 n} x_{n, t-1} \\\\\n& x_{2, t}=a_{20}+a_{21} x_{1, t-1}+a_{22} x_{2, t-1}+\\cdots+a_{2 n} x_{n, t-1} \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\n& x_{n, t}=a_{n 0}+a_{n 1} x_{1, t-1}+a_{n 2} x_{2, t-1}+\\cdots+a_{n n} x_{n, t-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.22}\\]\nIn matrix form, the system (3.22) can be written as\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nx_{1, t} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n, t}\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\na_{11} & \\cdots & a_{1 n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{n 1} & \\cdots & a_{n n}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nx_{1, t-1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n, t-2}\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\na_{10} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n 0}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\tag{3.23}\\]\nBy defining the vector of \\(x\\) as \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), the matrix of multiplicative parameters as \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), and the vector of the constants as \\(\\mathbf{a}_{0}\\), the system can be written as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}_{t}=\\mathbf{A x}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{a}_{0}\n\\tag{3.24}\\]\nIf \\(a_{i j}=0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\) in the system (3.23), then the \\(n\\) equations are uncoupled, and the system can be solved as \\(n\\) independent first-order linear difference equations with solutions\n\\[\nx_{i, t}=\\frac{a_{i 0}}{1-a_{i i}}+\\left(x_{i, 0}-\\frac{a_{i 0}}{1-a_{i i}}\\right)\\left(a_{i i}\\right)^{t}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_{i, 0}\\) is a boundary value for \\(x_{i}\\).\nThus, if we could transform the system (3.23) into one with a coefficient matrix that is diagonal, we could easily calculate the solution. The question is how to transform the system into one with a diagonal coefficient matrix.\nWe know from the properties of matrices that the coefficient matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) can be transformed as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{P J P}^{-1}\n\\tag{3.25}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) on its diagonal, and \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is a matrix consisting of the corresponding (right) eigenvectors. Equation (3.25) implies that\n\\[\\mathbf{A P}=\\mathbf{P J}\\]\nWe can use these properties to rewrite the system (3.24) as\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}_{t}=\\mathbf{A x}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{a}_{0}=\\mathbf{P J P}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{a}_{0}\n\\tag{3.26}\\]\nMultiplying both sides of (3.26) by \\(\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\), we get\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}=\\mathbf{J P}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\mathbf{a}_{0}\n\\]\nDefining a new vector of variables \\(\\mathbf{X}_{t}=\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{t}\\), and a new vector of constants \\(\\mathbf{A}_{0}=\\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\mathbf{a}_{0}\\), we can rewrite (3.24) as\n\\[\\mathbf{X}_{t}=\\mathbf{J} \\mathbf{X}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{A}_{0}\\]\nThus, by using the matrix consisting of the eigenvectors of the original coefficient matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) to define new variables and new constants, we can transform the original coupled system of difference equations to a system of decoupled difference equations in the newly defined variables, as in the case of differential equations. The decoupled system can be solved for each of the transformed variables in \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). We can then find the solutions for the original vector of variables by using the reverse transformation\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_{t}=\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{X}_{t}\\]\nBy using the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and the matrix of the corresponding (right) eigenvectors, we can solve the system of \\(n\\) first-order linear difference equations (3.22). The solution method is similar in spirit to the one for a system of \\(n\\) first-order differential equations discussed in Chapter 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the conditions for stability for discrete and continuous time systems are different. In continuous time, the conditions requires to compare the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_i\\) to zero (i.e. a positive eigenvalue is unstable, a negative eigenvalue is stable). In contrast, in discrete time systems, the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_i\\) (in absolute value) has to be compared to unity.(i.e. a stable eigenvalue is within the unit circle, an unstable eigenvalue is outside the unit circle).",

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nIn this chapter, we study techniques applied to dynamic optimizations. Optimization in dynamics economic problems, which are problems in which variables change over time, does not requires new principles vis-à-vis static problems but possesses a specific structure needed to take care about.\nThe most important part of this specific structure is the relation between stocks and flows. Some variables, which we will denote by \\(y\\), have the form of stocks, changing gradually over time. Other variables, which we will denote by \\(x\\), have the form of flows, which can change freely at any instant. Mathematically, stocks are called state variables and flows are called control variables.1\nStock variables evolves according both stocks and flows, control variables control changes in state variables. For instance, savings in period \\(t\\) determine the change in households wealth from period \\(t\\) to period \\(t+1\\). A general form of the volution of state variables is:\n\\[\ny_{t+1}-y_t=Q(y_t,x_t,t )\n\\tag{4.1}\\] where \\(t,t+1,...\\) are discrete time periods, \\(y\\) is a state variable (stocks), \\(x\\) is a control variable (flows) and \\(Q\\) is a vector function. There might be additional restrictions that we summarize under the form:\n\\[\nG(y_t,x_t,t)\\leq 0\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nNote that restrictions (4.1) and (4.2) have different structure: the former involves directly a dynamic restriction while the latter is a static.\nFurthermore, in most dynamic economic problems, agents have to optimize an objective function of the following additively-separable form:\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^T F(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\nsubject to restrictions (4.1) and (4.2). Periods start at \\(t=0\\) and end at \\(T\\), which is potentially infinite. For instance, the function \\(F(y_t,x_t,t)\\) can represent some households’ utility function or firms’ profit at date \\(t\\).2 Hence, we seek, in such examples, to maximize the sum of stream of instantaneous utilities (or profits) over time. The value of the initial stock at time 0 is taken as given but also at date T+1: such problems have therefore both initial and terminal conditions, the terminal condition being called transversality conditions.\nWe are going to present two widely used techniques in economics: optimal control and dynamic programming. Both are going to be applied in discrete and continuous time.",

    "section": "4.2 Optimal Control Methods",
    "text": "4.2 Optimal Control Methods\n\n4.2.1 The Optimal Control Method in Discrete Time\nIn the optimal control problem, we want to select the variables \\(y_t\\) and \\(x_t\\) for \\(t=0,1,2...,T\\) to find the optimal solution of (4.3) subject to the constraints (4.1) and (4.2). To say it differently, we want to find the sequence \\(x_0,x_1,x_2...x_T\\) and \\(y_1,y_2,...,y_T\\) (remember that \\(y_0\\) and \\(y_{T+1}\\) are given) satisfying this problem.\nTo do so, we define multipliers (or shadow values) and construct the Lagrangian function. Define as \\(\\mu_t\\) the multiplier for the constraints (4.2). These have the usual interpretation of shadow values for the constraints in period \\(t\\). The multipliers for the constraints (4.1) are different since they define the first-order change in the objective function if the constraint in the change of the stock is loosened (i.e. if we have a marginal increase in the stock variable \\(y_{t+1}\\)). They are therefore shadow values of the stock variables in period \\(t+1\\) and we denote them \\(\\lambda_{t+1}\\).\nWe define as \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) the Lagrangian function of the full intertemporal problem:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}= \\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\{F(y_t,x_t,t)+\\lambda_{t+1}\\left[y_t+Q(y_t,x_t,t)-y_{t+1}\\right]-\\mu_tG(y_t,x_t,t) \\}\n\\]\nNote that because of the time additive structure of the problem, multipliers are also dated at some period.\nThe first-order conditions for the optimization of the Lagrangian function with respect to the control variables \\(x\\) are:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_t}=0 : \\quad F_x(y_t,x_t,t)+\\lambda_{t+1}Q_x(y_t,x_t,t)-\\mu_tG_x(y_t,x_t,t)=0\n\\] for \\(t=0,1,...,T\\) and where \\(F_x\\), \\(Q_x,\\) and \\(G_x\\) are the partial first-order derivatives with respect to \\(x\\). Note again that we have \\(T+1\\) first-order conditions with respect to \\(x\\) but the only real differences between them is their date.\nWith respect to \\(y\\), the first-order conditions are a bit more complex because \\(y\\) appears in two consecutive periods, and therefore two terms of the sum. Let’s rearrange the Lagrangian function to see it clearly.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}= \\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\{F(y_t,x_t,t)+\\lambda_{t+1}Q(y_t,x_t,t)+y_t(\\lambda_{t+1}-\\lambda_{t})-\\mu_tG(y_t,x_t,t) \\}\\\\\n+F(y_0,x_0,0)+\\lambda_1Q(y_0,x_0,0)+y_0\\lambda_1-y_{T+1}\\lambda_{T+1}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThe final four terms in the previous equation refer to given value of \\(y\\) in period \\(0\\) and \\(T+1\\). The first order-condition for the optimum of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) for \\(y_t\\), \\(t=,1,2...,T\\) are:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_t}=0 : &  \\quad F_y(y_t,x_t,t)+\\lambda_{t+1}Q_y(y_t,x_t,t)+\\lambda_{t+1}-\\lambda_t-\\mu_tG_y(y_t,x_t,t)=0\\\\\n& \\Rightarrow \\lambda_{t+1}-\\lambda_t=-\\left[ F_y(y_t,x_t,t)+\\lambda_{t+1}Q_y(y_t,x_t,t)-\\mu_tG_y(y_t,x_t,t)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\nThese conditions can be written in a more comprehensive and economically useful way. Define a new function, the Hamiltonian function \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) as follows:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}(y_t,x_t,\\lambda_{t+1},t)= F(y_t,x_t,t)+\\lambda_{t+1}Q(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\nEquation (4.5) suggests that the control variable \\(x\\) must be selected to optimize \\(\\mathcal{H}(y_t,x_t,\\lambda_{t+1},t)\\) under the constraint \\(G(y_t,x_t,t)\\leq 0\\) which can be written into a new Lagrangian:\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}(y_t,x_t,\\lambda_{t+1},t)= \\mathcal{H}(y_t,x_t,\\lambda_{t+1},t)-\\mu_tG(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\]\nThen equation (4.4) can be written more simply as:\n\\[\n\\lambda_{t+1}-\\lambda_t=-\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}_y(y_t,x_t,\\lambda_{t+1},t)\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\nFinally, from (4.1) and (4.5), we get (using the Enveloppe Theorem):\n\\[\ny_{t+1}-y_t=\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}_{\\lambda}(y_t,x_t,\\lambda_{t+1},t)=Q(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\tag{4.7}\\] These properties of the Hamiltonian function are known as the Maximum Principle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Principle\n\n\n\nThe necessary first-order conditions for the optimization of (4.3) under the constraints (4.1) and (4.2) are the following: (1) for each \\(t\\), the control variables \\(x_t\\) optimize the Hamiltonian function (4.5) under the static constraints (4.2). (2) The changes of \\(y_t\\) and \\(\\lambda_t\\) over time are determined by the difference equations (4.6) and (4.7).\n\n\nThe Maximum Principle, proposed by Pontryagin et al. (1962), facilitates the determination of the first-order conditions for intertemporal optimization problems. It also gives easier interpretations of the first-order conditions of dynamic economic problems we have just seen.\nIn particular, changes in the decision variables \\(x_t\\) directly impact the objective function (4.3) but also on \\(y_{t+1}\\) through the impact on \\(Q\\). Hence, the change in the objective function is found by multiplying the impact of \\(x\\) on Q with the shadow value \\(\\lambda_{t+1}\\) of \\(y_{t+1}\\). The Hamiltonian provides a simple way of converting the one-period objective function \\(F\\) to account for the future impact of the current choice of the control variable \\(x\\). A similar economic interpretation can be obtained to the first-order conditions for the state variable \\(y\\). A marginal change in \\(y\\) in period \\(t\\) gives the marginal change \\(F_y-\\mu G_y\\) in period \\(t\\), given the shadow value of \\(\\lambda_{t+1}\\) The right-hand side of (4.4) may be interpreted as a dividend. The change \\(\\lambda_{t+1}-\\lambda_t\\) is like a capital gain. Equation (4.4) tells us that he dividend plus the capital gain should be equal to zero: at the optimim, there can be no excess return from \\(y\\).\n\n\n4.2.2 The Optimal Control Method in Continuous Time\nIn many applications, it is more convenient to treat time as a continuous variable. In such case, Equations (4.1) and (4.5) become:\n\\[\n\\dot{y}(t)=\\frac{dy}{dt}=Q(y(t),x(t),t)\n\\tag{4.8}\\] \\[\nG(y(t),x(t),t)\\leq 0\n\\tag{4.9}\\]\nFor the objective function, Equation (4.3) in continuous time becomes:\n\\[\n\\int_0^{T}F(y(t),x(t),t)dt\n\\tag{4.10}\\]\nWe can use the Hamiltonian function as before:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}=F(y(t),x(t),t)+\\lambda(t)Q(y(t),x(t),t)\n\\tag{4.11}\\]\nThe FOC for the optimization of the Hamiltonian function (4.11) under the static constraints (4.9) are:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial x(t)}-\\mu(t)\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x(t)}=0 \\Rightarrow F_x+\\lambda(t)Q_x=\\mu(t)G_x\n\\tag{4.12}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial y(t)}=-\\dot\\lambda(t) \\Rightarrow  F_y+\\lambda(t)Q_y=-\\dot{\\lambda}(t)\n\\tag{4.13}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial \\lambda(t)}=\\dot{y}(t) \\Rightarrow \\dot{y}(t)=Q(y(t),x(t),t)\n\\tag{4.14}\\]\nThese three equations are the continuous-time equivalent of the discrete time first-order conditions previously obtained.",

    "text": "4.3 Dynamic Programming and the Bellman Equation\nDynamic programming is an alternative method of solving the problem at the beginning of this chapter. It is an extremely useful in problems that combine time and uncertainty as ofent happens in economics.\nOur problem is the optimization of:\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^{T}F(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\]\nunder the constraints:\n\\[\ny_{t+1}-y_t=Q(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\]\nand\n\\[G(y_t,x_t,t) \\leq 0\\]\nfor \\(t=0,1,2,..,T\\). Again, the vectors of initial and final stocks \\(y_0\\) and \\(y_{T+1}\\) are taken as given. We can define the optimal value that comes out of this problem as a function of the initial stocks \\(y_0\\). Denote this function as \\(V(y_0)\\). The vector of the first derivatives of this function \\(V_y(y_0)\\) is the vector of the shadow values of these initial stocks.\nThe additive separability of the objective function and the constraints allow us to make an important generalization of the above ide. Instead of starting off at time zero, let us assume that we start off at time \\(t=\\tau\\). For the decisions thaty start at \\(\\tau\\), the only thing that matters from the past is the vector of stocks \\(y_{\\tau}\\), which is the result of past decisions. Our problem is to optimize an objective function such as (4.3) and the associated constraints, with time starting from \\(\\tau\\) and not 0. We define \\(V(y_{\\tau},\\tau))\\) as the optimal value that emerges as a function of stocks \\(y_{\\tau}\\) and period \\(\\tau\\). The vector of the first derivatives \\(V_y(y_{\\tau},\\tau)\\) denotes the marginal increase in the optimal value for a small increase of stocks in period \\(\\tau\\), which is the vector of shadow values of the initial stocks for the optimization problem that starts in period \\(\\tau\\). This applies at all \\(t\\).\nLet us then select any \\(t\\) and exime the decision of choosing the values of the control variables for thaht period. Any choice of the control viarable \\(x_t\\) will lead to stocks \\(y_{t+1}\\) through ([-#eq-generaldynamics]). What remains is to solve the subproblem for period \\(t+1\\) and to find the optimal value \\(V(y_{t+1},t+1)\\). The total value in period \\(t\\) of a choice for the control variables \\(x_t\\) starting oof with stocks \\(y_t\\), can be separated into two terms: \\(F(y_t,x_t,t)\\) which occurs in the current period; and \\(V(y_{t+1},t+1)\\), which comes about in future periods. The choice of \\(x_t\\) must optimize the sum of these two terms under the relevant constraints. In other words, we have:\n\\[\nV(y_t,t)= \\max_{x_t}\\left[F(y_t,x_t,t)+V(y_t,t+1) \\right]\n\\tag{4.15}\\]\nunder the constraints (4.1) and (4.2) for the specific \\(t\\).\nThis method of intertemporal optimization, as a succession of static optimization problems, was proposed by Richard Bellman and is called dynamic programming. The idea that whatever the choice in period \\(t\\), the choices for the subproblem that begins in period \\(t+1\\) should be optimal, is known as Bellman’s principle of optimality. The optimal value function \\(V(y_t,t)\\) is called the Bellman’s value function and equation (4.16) the Bellman equation.\nThe Bellman equation gives us a recursive method for solving the original optimization problem. The idea is to start from the end and go backward. In period \\(T\\), there is no future, only the requirement for a given final stock \\(Y_{T+1}\\). Therefore:\n\\[\nV(y_T,T)=\\max_{x_T}F(Y_t,x_T,T)\n\\]\nunder the constraints:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nY_{T+1}=Y_T+Q(y_T,x_T,T) \\\\\nG(y_T,x_T,T) \\leq 0\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThis is a simple probem of static optimization, which gives us the optimal value function \\(V(Y_T,T)\\). This function can in turn be used in the right-hand side of (4.16) for \\(t=T-1\\). This equation is then another static problem, which gives us the optimal value function \\(V(y_{T-1},T-1)\\). We can continue iun this way until we reach period \\(0\\). In pratice, this process provides results for the simplest problems. Analytical solutions exist when the functions \\(F\\), \\(G\\), and \\(Q\\) have a very simple form. Where analytical solutions do not exist, we can use numerical solutions, acknowledging that, for many economic applications, we have a better methods than the recursive method to find or characterize the solution.\nNote that in the presence of uncertainty, the Bellman equation takes the form:\n\\[\nV(y_t,t)= \\max_{x_t}\\left[F(y_t,x_t,t)+E_tV(y_t,t+1) \\right]\n\\tag{4.16}\\] where \\(E\\) is the mathematical expectations operator. To find the Bellamn equations in continuous time, note that from (4.16) takes the form:\n\\[\nV(y(t),t)= \\max_{x(t)}\\left[F(y(t),x(t),t)\\Delta t+V(y(t+\\Delta ty,t+\\Delta t) \\right]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta t\\) is a small time interval. using a Taylor expansion of the last right-hand side term of the equation above, we get:\n\\[\nV(y(t+\\Delta ty,t+\\Delta t)=V(y(t),t)+V_y(y(t),t)\\left[y(t+\\Delta t)-y(t)\\right]+V_t(y(t),t)\\Delta t\n\\] and where: \\(y(t+\\Delta t)-y(t)=Q(y(t),x(t),t)\\Delta t\\) from (4.1). Plug this expression and the previous to obtain:\n\\[\nV(y(t),t)= \\max_{x(t)}\\left[F(y(t),x(t),t)\\Delta t+ V(y(t),t)+V_y(y(t),t)Q(y(t),x(t),t)\\Delta t+V_t(y(t),t)\\Delta t \\right]\n\\]\nDivide both side by \\(\\Delta t\\) and cancelling \\(V(y(t),t)\\) results in:\n\\[\n0= \\max_{x(t)}\\left[F(y(t),x(t),t)+V_y(y(t),t)Q(y(t),x(t),t)+V_t(y(t),t) \\right]\n\\] Which is a Bellman Equation in continuous time.",

    "section": "4.4 Present and Current Value Problems",
    "text": "4.4 Present and Current Value Problems\nBefore going through additional details, we need to precise two fundamental points:\n\nDynamic economic problems often discount future values of the objective function\nif \\(T=+\\infty\\), there is no guarantee that the objective function (4.3) (or the continuous time version (4.10 ) is converging. Discounting the objective function is one way to guarantee such convergence.\n\nWhen discounted, the objective functions write:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{t=0}^T \\beta^t F(y_t,x_t,t), \\quad \\text{in discrete time} \\\\\n\\int_{t=0}^T \\exp^{-\\rho} F(y_t,x_t,t) \\quad \\text{in continuous time}\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{4.17}\\]\nwith \\(\\rho&gt;0\\) the rate of time preference and \\(\\beta=\\frac{1}{1+\\rho} \\in(0,1)\\), the discount factor.3 This two parameters defines the degree of impatience of the economic agents, or how much they subjectively value the present versus the future. In particular, a low \\(\\beta\\) (and a high \\(\\rho\\) ) means that the agents is relatively impatient (she puts less weight on future value of the objective function).\nFrom there, there are two different (although equivalent) way to frame the problem. Either build the present-value Hamiltonian or the current-value Hamiltonian. In continuous time, the present-value Hamiltonian is:4\n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}=F(y(t),x(t),t)\\exp^{-\\rho t}+\\tilde{\\lambda}(t)Q(y(t),x(t),t)\n\\] The first-order conditions do not merely change in comparison to Section 4.2.2:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}}{\\partial x(t)}=0 &:& \\quad F_x\\exp^{-\\rho t}-\\tilde{\\lambda}(t)Q_x=0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}}{\\partial y(t)}=-\\dot{\\tilde{\\lambda}} &:& \\quad F_y\\exp^{-\\rho t}-\\tilde{\\lambda}(t)Q_y=-\\dot{\\tilde{\\lambda}}(t) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}}{\\partial \\lambda(t)}=\\dot{y}(t)&:& \\quad Q(y(t),x(t),t)=\\dot{y}(t)\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{4.18}\\]\nUsing an appropriate change of variable, the current-value Hamiltonian is:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}=\\tilde{\\mathcal{H}}\\exp^{\\rho t}= F(y(t),x(t),t)+\\lambda (t)Q(y(t),x(t),t)\n\\] and where \\(\\lambda(t)=\\tilde{\\lambda}(t) \\exp^{-\\rho t}\\). Noting that \\(-\\dot{\\tilde{\\lambda}}(t)=-(\\dot{\\lambda}(t)-\\rho\\lambda (t))\\). The FOC becomes:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial x(t)}=0 & : & F_x-\\lambda(t)Q_x=0  \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial y(t)}=-\\dot\\lambda(t)-\\rho \\lambda(t) \\equiv -\\dot{\\tilde{\\lambda}}\\exp^{-\\rho t} &:&  F_y-\\lambda(t)Q_y-\\rho \\lambda(t)=-\\dot{\\lambda}(t)  \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial \\lambda(t)}=\\dot{y}(t) &:& Q(y(t),x(t),t)=\\dot{y}(t)\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{4.19}\\]\nNote that using the two first equations in (4.18) (in particular by taking the time derivative of the first equation to eliminate the terms in \\(\\tilde{\\lambda}\\)) leads to the same expression for the second equation of (4.19). Hence, starting with the current-value Hamiltonian may save some computations.\nA similar approach can be done in the discrete time problem. The present-value Lagrangian writes:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{\\tilde{L}}=\\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\beta^{t} F(y_,x_t,t)+\\tilde{\\lambda}_{t+1}[Q(y_t,x_t,t)+y_t-y_{t+1}]\n\\] with FOC:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{\\tilde{L}}}{\\partial x_t}=0 & : & \\beta^t F_x+\\tilde{\\lambda}_{t+1}Q_x=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{\\tilde{L}}}{\\partial y_{t}}=0 &: & \\beta^t F_y+\\tilde{\\lambda}_{t+1}Q_y+\\tilde{\\lambda}_{t+1}-\\tilde{\\lambda}_t=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{\\tilde{L}}}{\\partial \\tilde{\\lambda}_{t+1}}=0 &: & y_{t+1}-y_t=Q(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4.20}\\]\nUsing the change of variable \\(\\tilde{\\lambda}=\\beta^{t}\\lambda_t\\), the current-value Lagrangian is now:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{\\tilde{L}}=\\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\beta^{t} F(y_,x_t,t)+\\lambda_{t+1}[Q(y_t,x_t,t)+y_t-y_{t+1}]\n\\] with the following FOCs:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{\\tilde{L}}}{\\partial x_t}=0 & : &  F_x+\\lambda_{t+1}Q_x=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{\\tilde{L}}}{\\partial y_{t}}=0 &: &  F_y+\\lambda_{t+1}Q_y+\\lambda_{t+1}-\\beta^{-1}\\lambda_t=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{\\tilde{L}}}{\\partial \\lambda_{t+1}}=0 &: & y_{t+1}-y_t=Q(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4.21}\\]\nThe main differences with the present-value FOCS are that the \\(\\beta^t\\) in the first equation eliminates themselves while in the second equation, \\(\\beta^{t+1}\\) factorizes the term in \\(t+1\\) and the \\(\\beta^t\\) factorizes the term in \\(t\\), cancelling each other up to one factor \\(\\beta\\). As in the continuous time case, the two formulation are equivalent once solved, although the current-value approach saves additional computations.\nLet us look at discounted problem with the dynamic programming approach. Define:\n\\[\nV(y_t,t)=\\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\beta^t F(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\tag{4.22}\\]\nsubject to:\n\\[\ny_{t+1}-y_t=Q(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\] Note that the constraint implies \\(x_t \\in H(y_t,y_{t+1},t)\\). Problem (4.22) writes:5\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nV(y_t,t)= \\max_{x_t \\in H(y_t,y_{t+1})}\\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\beta^t F(y_t,x_t,t) & =\\max_{x_t \\in H(y_t,y_{t+1})}\\left[F(y_t,x_t,t) + \\beta \\sum_{t=0}^{T}\\beta^t F(y_{t+1},x_{t+1},t+1)\\right]\\\\\n& =  \\max_{x_t \\in H(y_t,y_{t+1})}\\left[F(y_t,x_t,t) + \\beta V(y_{t+1},t+1)\\right]\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{4.23}\\]\nTo maximize the Bellman equation, write the static lagrangian:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}=F(y_t,x_t,t) + \\beta V(y_{t+1},t+1)+\\lambda\\left[ Q(y_t,x_t,t)+y_t-y_{t+1}\\right]\n\\]\nThe first-order conditions are:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_t}=0 & :& F_x+\\lambda Q_x=0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_{t+1}}=0 & :& -\\lambda +\\beta V_{y}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda}=0 & : & y_{t+1}-y_t=Q(y_t,x_t,t)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nWhich gives the system to be solved recursively.\nThe Benveniste-Scheinkman condition gives using (4.23):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial V(y_t,t)}{\\partial y_t}=F_y+\\lambda\\left[Q_y+1\\right] \\Rightarrow  \\frac{\\partial V(y_{t+1},t+1)}{\\partial y_{t+1}}=F_y+\\lambda\\left[Q_y+1\\right]\n\\] which can be plugged in the FOCs above.\nIn continuous time, the discounted Bellman Equation is:6\n\\[\n-\\dot{V}(y(t),t)+\\rho V(y(t),t)=\\max_{x(t) \\in H(y(t),t)}\\left[F(y(t),x(t),t)+v_y(y(t),t)Q(y(t),x(t),t) \\right]\n\\]",

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nThe Solow model constitutes a cornerstone in the growth analysis. Pre-solovian Growth Theory, turning mainly around Harrod and Domar contributions, concluded on the instability of long-run economic growth. Such conclusions were at odds at observed data. Although the Solow model has many pitfalls, it constitute a good starting point to discuss the structure of the many macroeconomic models that usually keep the same production structure.\nThe contributions of Solow takes place within a range of observations, called Kaldor’s stylized facts (after Kaldor, 1963). Namely:\nNote a consequence of point 5. is that, because the labor income share \\(wL/Y\\) is constant and that GDP per capita \\(Y/L\\) grows, the wage rate \\(w\\) has necessarily the same growth rate of the GDP per capita.\nThese stylized fact are the benchmark points to evaluate any model of economic growth. 1\nIn the rest of this chapter, we first discuss an important property of benchmark growth model. Afterwards, we describe and solve the Solow model in discrete time (the continuous time being studied in Appendix). We study the equilibrium growth rates and transitional dynamics and also discuss further topics such as the properties of factor prices, the Golden Rule of capital accumulation and growth accounting.",

    "text": "5.2 A general property: the balanced-growth path\nBefore starting with the presentation of the Solow model, we derive an important and useful property of any one-sector growth model provided it includes capital accumulation. This property, called the balanced growth path (or BGP), focuses on the equilibrium growth rates of aggregate quantities. We consider a simple economy characterized (for the moment) by two equations:\n\\[\n  K_{t+1}=I_t+(1-\\delta)K_t\n   \\tag{5.1}\\]\n\\[\n  Y_t=C_t+I_t\n   \\tag{5.2}\\]\nEquation (5.1) represents the capital accumulation equation2 while Equation (5.2) is the aggregate resource constraint of the economy. Variables \\(K_t\\), \\(I_t\\), \\(C_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) the aggregate stock of capital installed at date \\(t\\) and investment realized at date \\(t\\), aggregate consumption at date \\(t\\) and GDP at date \\(t\\) respectively. The parameter \\(\\delta \\in(0,1)\\) represents depreciation of the capital stock at each period.\n\nDefinition 5.1 A balanced-growth path is a path \\(\\{Y_t,C_t,I_t,K_t \\}_{t \\geq 0}\\) along which the quantities \\(Y_t\\), \\(K_t\\), and \\(C_t\\) are positive and growth at constant rates, which we denotes \\(g_Y\\), \\(g_K\\) and \\(g_C\\) respectively.\n\nWe can show then:\n\nProposition 5.1 Let \\(\\{Y_t,C_t,I_t,K_t \\}_{t \\geq 0}\\) be a balanced-growth path. Then, given the capital accumulation equation and the aggregate resource constraint, the following holds:\n\nIf there is a BGP, then \\(g_Y=g_K=g_C=g_I\\) and the ratios \\(K/Y\\), \\(C/Y\\) and \\(I/Y\\) are constant.\nif \\(K/Y\\) and \\(C/Y\\) are constant, then \\(Y\\), \\(K\\), \\(C\\) and \\(I\\) all grow at the same constant rate, i.e. there is a balanced-growth path with the additional property that all aggregate variables grow at the same growth rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first part of the proposition: by definition, \\(g_Y\\), \\(g_C\\), \\(g_I\\) and \\(g_K\\) are constant. Rewriting Equation (5.1):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta K_{t+1}}{K_t}=g_K=\\frac{I_t}{K_t}-\\delta \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{I_t}{K_t}=g_K+\\delta\n\\] Since the right-hand side of this equation is constant, then the ratio \\(I_t/K_t\\) is constant and therefore \\(I_t\\) and \\(K_t\\) have the same growth rate (\\(g_K=g_I\\)). We can focus on the aggregate resource constraint:\n\\[\nY_t=C_t+I_t \\Rightarrow \\Delta Y_t=\\Delta C_t+\\Delta I_t \\Rightarrow g_Y=\\frac{\\Delta Y_t}{Y_t}=\\frac{C_t}{Y_t}g_C+\\frac{I_t}{Y_t}g_I\n\\] Since \\(\\frac{I_t}{Y_t}=1-\\frac{C_t}{Y_t}\\) and \\(g_I=g_K\\), this equation becomes:\n\\[\ng_Y=\\frac{C_t}{Y_t}(g_C-g_K)+g_K\n\\] There are two possibilities: either \\(g_C=g_K\\), from which we directly derive that \\(g_Y=g_K=g_C=g_I\\) or \\(g_K\\neq g_C\\) and the last equation rewrites:\n\\[\n\\frac{C_t}{Y_t}=\\frac{g_Y-g_K}{g_C-g_K}\n\\] The right-hand side is constant, meaning that the ratio of \\(C_t\\) over \\(Y_t\\) is also constant, and therefore they grow at the same rate. Then, the RHS is equal to unity and therefore \\(C_t=Y_t\\) which contradicts the fact \\(I_t&gt;0\\). Hence, \\(g_C\\neq g_K\\) is not possible according to the definition of a BGP and implies that \\(g_C=g_K=g_Y=g_I\\).\nTo prove the second part of the proposition: Assume \\(K/Y\\) and \\(C/Y\\) are constant. Then, by definition, \\(g_Y=g_K=g_C\\) and therefore \\(\\frac{I_t}{Y_t}=1-\\frac{C_t}{Y_t}\\) meaning \\(g_I=g_K\\). To show that the growth rate is constant, we use Equation (5.1):\n\\[\ng_k=\\frac{I_t}{K_t}-\\delta\n\\] where the right-hand side is constant.\n\n\n\nThis is a quite important result as it implies that there can’t be persistent deviations of aggregate quantities growth rate. Furthermore, this not only gives us a starting point to link theoretical quantities with observable but also regularities to reproduce or not given the structure we give to the model.",

It follows that aggregate savings is given by: \\(S_t=sY_t\\).

The model focus on a closed economy (no exporations or importations). There is no government intervention and the economy is at full employment such that \\(L_t=N_t\\).

To do so, we need to rewrite ([-#eq-aggregate-equilibrium]) in effective labor unit. Denote GDP in effective labor \\(\\tilde{y}_t=\\frac{Y_t}{A_tL_t}\\) and effective labor capital stock \\(\\tilde{k}_t=\\frac{K_t}{A_t L_t}\\), then we can derive:\n\\[\n\\frac{K_{t+1}}{A_t L_t}=\\frac{sY_t+(1-\\delta)K_t}{A_t L_t}=s\\tilde{y_t}+(1-\\delta)\\tilde{k}_t\n\\]\nUsing the assumption on the evolution of population and technical progress (e.g. \\(L_{t+1}=(1+n)L_t\\) and \\(A_{t+1}=(1+g)A_t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{A_{t+1}L_{t+1}}{A_t L_t}\\frac{K_{t+1}}{A_{t+1}L_{t+1}}=(1+n)(1+g)\\tilde{k}_{t+1}=s\\tilde{y_t}+(1-\\delta)\\tilde{k}_t\n\\]\nTo get rid of \\(\\tilde{y}_t\\), we use the production function:\n\\[\n\\frac{Y_t}{A_tL_t}=\\tilde{y}_t=\\frac{K_t^{\\alpha}(A_tL_t)^{1-\\alpha}}{A_{t}L_{t}}=\\left(\\frac{K_t}{A_t L_t}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{A_t L_t}{A_t L_t}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}=\\tilde{k}_t^{\\alpha}\n\\]\nThe evolution of the capital stock in terms of effective labor is then:\n\\[\n(1+n)(1+g)\\tilde{k}_{t+1}=s\\tilde{k}_t^{\\alpha}+(1-\\delta)\\tilde{k}_t\n\\tag{5.4}\\]\nEquation (5.4) is the “fundemental Solow equation”, which is a non-linear first-order difference equation in \\(\\tilde{k}_t\\).

On the other hand, at each period, the capital stock in terms of effective labor depletes because of physical depreciation (effect of \\(\\delta\\)) but also because there are more people (\\(L_t\\) increasing at rate \\(n\\)) and that workers are more efficient (\\(A_t\\) increasing at rate \\(g\\)). 4 To say it differently, as there are more productive \\(\\frac{K_{t+1}}{A_{t+1}L_{t+1}}\\) decreases.

As economists studying growth, we are interested into growth in per capita quantities. Assuming away technical progress (by putting \\(g=0\\)) implies that the per capita variable reach the steady state and stop to grow, which is at odd with what is observed in the data. Another way to say it, growth through an extensive process (increasing private inputs such as capital stock and labor, as hours of work or number of people working) cannot be a source of persistent growth. This is a direct consequence of marginal decreasing returns of capital: even in the favorable situation of linear homogeneity of the production (e.g. doubling all inputs doubles output), GDP per capita has decreasing returns in terms of stock of capital per capita meaning that any increase in \\(k_t\\) makes GDP larger but less and less.

In contrast, dynamic efficiency was the only criterion to evaluate an economy in the Solow model but it was not based on a welfare criterion.",

Using (6.5) into (6.4) and the budget constraint written in terms of effective labor, and transforming consumption per capita in the (6.4) into consumption in terms of effective labor, we obtain the discrete-time dynamic system of the Ramsey model:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{c}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{c}_{t}}\\right)^{\\theta}=\\frac{\\beta\\left(f'(\\tilde{k}_{t+1})+(1-\\delta) \\right)}{(1+n)(1+g)^{\\theta}}\\\\\n(1+g)(1+n)\\tilde{k}_{t+1}=f(\\tilde{k}_t)+(1-\\delta)\\tilde{k}_t-\\tilde{c}_t\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{6.6}\\] In steady state, \\(k_{t+1}=k_t=k^*\\) and \\(c_{t+1}=c_t=c^*\\) and thus:3\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nf'(\\tilde{k}^*)=\\frac{(1+n)(1+g)^{\\theta}}{\\beta}-(1-\\delta) \\\\\n\\tilde{c}^*=f(\\tilde{k}^*)-(n+g+\\delta)k^*\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nGiven \\(f'(\\tilde{k}^*)\\) is decreasing, this defines a unique capital stock in the first equation. Given this, the steady consumption is obtained with the second equation. To characterize the BGP, we note that for any variable \\(x_t \\Rightarrow \\frac{x_{t+1}}{x_t}=1+g_x\\). Then, rewrite the Euler equation such that:\n\\[\n(1+g_{c})^{\\theta}=\\frac{\\beta\\left(f'(\\tilde{k}_{t+1})+(1-\\delta) \\right)}{(1+n)(1+g)^{\\theta}}\n\\] As \\(g_c\\) is constant along a BGP, so is \\(\\tilde{k}=\\frac{K_t}{A_t L_t}\\) and therefore \\(\\frac{Y}{AL}=\\tilde{y}=f(\\tilde{k})\\) is also constant, i.e. \\(\\tilde{y}\\tilde{k}=f(\\tilde{k})/\\tilde{k}\\) is constant and therefore \\(g_k=g_y\\). Using the budget constraint:\n\\[\n(1+n)(1+g)(1+g_k)=\\frac{f(\\tilde{k})}{\\tilde{k}}+(1-\\delta)-\\frac{\\tilde{c}}{k}\n\\]\nAs both \\(g_k\\) and \\(f(\\tilde{k})/\\tilde{k}\\) are constant, the ratio \\(\\frac{\\tilde{c}}{\\tilde{k}}\\) is also constant implying \\(g_c=g_k=g_y\\). As a result, aggregate variables \\(C,K,Y\\) grows at rate \\(n+g\\) while per capita variable \\(c,k,y\\) grows at rate \\(g\\).\nWe study the transitional dynamics by linearizing the system (6.6) in the neighborhood of the steady state. Totally differentiate the system:4\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\theta \\frac{d\\tilde{c}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{c}}- \\theta \\frac{d\\tilde{c}_{t}}{\\tilde{c}}= \\frac{f''(\\tilde{k}^*)\\tilde{k}^* \\frac{d \\tilde{k}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{k}^*}}{f'(\\tilde{k}^{*})+(1-\\delta)}=\\frac{\\beta f''( \\tilde{k}^*)\\tilde{k}^* \\frac{d \\tilde{k}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{k}^*}}{(1+n)(1+g)^{\\theta}} \\\\\n(1+n)(1+g)\\frac{d\\tilde{k}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{k}^*}=\\underbrace{\\left(f'(\\tilde{k}^*)+(1-\\delta) \\right)}_{=(1+n)(1+g)^{\\theta}/\\beta}\\frac{d \\tilde{k}_t}{\\tilde{k}^*}-\\frac{\\tilde{c}^*}{\\tilde{k}^*}\\frac{d \\tilde{c}_t}{c^*}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nOr in matrix form:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\theta & -\\frac{\\beta f''(\\tilde{k}^*)}{(1+n)(1+g)^{\\theta}} \\\\ 0 & (1+n)(1+g)  \\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\frac{d \\tilde{c}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{c}^*} \\\\  \\frac{d \\tilde{k}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{k}^*} \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\theta & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\tilde{c}^*}{\\tilde{k}^*} &  (1+n)(1+g)^{\\theta}/\\beta  \\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\frac{d \\tilde{c}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{c}^*} \\\\  \\frac{d \\tilde{k}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{k}^*} \\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\frac{d \\tilde{c}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{c}^*} \\\\  \\frac{d \\tilde{k}_{t+1}}{\\tilde{k}^*} \\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nInverting the matrix on the left-hand side, we obtain the Jacobian matrix. We can show that the Jacobian matrix has a single eigenvalue within the unit circle, which means that we have a saddle-path.\n\n\n6.7.3 An alternative resolution: using ratios\nIn this section, we propose an other approach to characterize the balanced-growth path of the Ramsey model. The strategy relies on rewriting the system in terms of growth rates and ratios that are constantalong the BGP which allows to rewrite the dynamics in a linear form. Assume a Cobb-Douglas technology \\(Y=K^{\\alpha}\\left(A L \\right)^{(1-\\alpha)}\\). Typically, the equilibrium path in per capita terms can be described by:5\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)} \\equiv g_c=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\left(\\alpha\\frac{y}{k}-\\delta-\\rho\\right) \\\\\n& \\frac{\\dot{k}(t)}{k(t)} \\equiv g_k=\\frac{y(t)}{k(t)}-\\frac{c(t)}{k(t)}-\\left(\\delta+n\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=k^{\\alpha}A(t)^{1-\\alpha} \\Rightarrow g_y=\\alpha g_k+(1-\\alpha )g_A\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand define \\(z(t)=\\frac{y}{k}\\) and \\(x(t)=\\frac{c}{k}\\). We have:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\ng_z=g_y-g_k \\Rightarrow g_z=-(1-\\alpha)(z-(n+\\delta)-x)\\\\\ng_x=g_c-g_k \\Rightarrow g_x=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\left(\\alpha\\frac{\\tilde{y}}{\\tilde{k}}-\\delta-\\rho \\right)-z+(\\delta+n)+x\\\\\ng_y=\\alpha g_k+(1-\\alpha)g_A\n\\end{aligned}\\] which is linear in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\). It is easy to show that for \\(g_x=g_z=0\\) (i.e. in steady state), we have by definition \\(g_y=g_k=g_c=g_A\\), where the last equality comes from the third equation of the system above. We may then derive steady state values of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) by solving the two others equations:\n\\[\nz=\\frac{(\\rho+\\delta)+\\theta g_A}{\\alpha}, \\quad x= \\frac{(\\rho+(1-\\alpha)\\delta)-\\alpha n+(\\theta-\\alpha) g_A}{\\alpha}\n\\] Furthermore, we can also linearize the expressions of \\(g_z\\) and \\(g_x\\) to study transitional dynamics.\nNote that an advantage of this method is that solving using ratios means that we are scale-invariant: it does not matter if the system is written in terms of aggregate variable or per capita or in effective labor (as soon as we keep consistency between the set of equations).",

    "text": "8.2 The Model\nThe main structure of the model is as follows:\n\nThe level of technology/ efficiency that augments the labour input in the production is a function of the average capital-labour ratio in the economy. The motivation for this is that investment of a firm brings productivity gains from its use from the labour. The firm builds up the knowledge (technical expertise) of how to efficiently use the capital by accumulating it, i.e., there is “learning-by-doing” (e.g., production lines). This learning-by-doing effect has an aggregate impact, when any individual firm’s technical efficiency is public knowledge, so that all firms can benefit from the technological advance for the use of capital in the production. This gives the link between ” \\(A_{i}\\) ” (i.e., some \\(i\\) th firm’s efficiency) and the average capital-labour ratio in the economy.\nThe level of technology is assumed to be \\(A \\equiv \\bar{A} k\\), where \\(k\\) is the average of per-capita capital stock and \\(\\bar{A}&gt;0\\) measures the efficiency of use of the capital\nThe production function takes the form: \\(Y_{i}=F\\left(K_{i}, A L_{i}\\right)=L_{i} F\\left(k_{i}, \\bar{A} k\\right) \\equiv L_{i} \\bar{A} k f\\left(\\frac{k_{i}}{\\bar{A} k}\\right)\\). Thus, there are decreasing returns to capital at the firm-level since the firm is so small that it does not take into account its impact on \\(A\\). However, there are constant returns to capital in symmetric equilibrium since \\(k_{i}=k\\).\nOne-sector model of growth: \\(\\dot{K}=Y-C-\\delta K\\)\nFrom the consumption-side, the representative household chooses its consumption and next period assets to maximize its lifetime utility \\(U=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\rho-n) t} u(c) d t\\), subject to its budget constraint: \\(\\dot{b}(t)=(r-n) b(t)+w-c\\), where \\(u(c)=\\frac{c^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta}\\).\nPopulation grows at exogenous rate \\(n\\)\n\nFor any individual producer the level of efficiency \\(A(\\bar{A} k)\\) is taken as given, along with the prices of inputs, when choosing capital and labour to maximize its per period profits \\(\\pi_{i}\\), i.e.,\n\\[\n\\max _{K_{i}(t), L_{i}(t)} \\pi_{i}=F\\left(K_{i}(t), A(t) L_{i}(t)\\right)-R(t) K_{i}(t)-w(t) L_{i}(t)\n\\]\nTherefore the optimal rules are\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\pi_{i}}{\\partial K_{i}} & =0  \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow R  & =F_{K_{i}}\\left(K_{i}, A L_{i}\\right) \\\\ & =\\frac{\\partial L_{i} \\bar{A} k f\\left(\\frac{k_{i}}{\\bar{A} k}\\right)}{\\partial K_{i}} \\\\\n& =f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{k_{i}}{\\bar{A} k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\frac{\\partial \\pi_{i}}{\\partial L_{i}} & =0 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow w &  =F_{L_{i}}\\left(K_{i}, A L_{i}\\right)\\\\\n& =A F_{A L_{i}}\\left(K_{i}, A L_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\partial L_{i} \\bar{A} k f\\left(\\frac{k_{i}}{\\bar{A} k}\\right)}{\\partial L_{i}} \\\\\n& =\\bar{A} k f\\left(\\frac{k_{i}}{\\bar{A} k}\\right)-k_{i} f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{k_{i}}{\\bar{A} k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince all producers are identical, the equilibrium must be symmetric, i.e., \\(k_{i}=k\\) for \\(\\forall i\\). Therefore, from the asset market equilibrium condition ( \\(b(t)=k\\) and \\(r=R(t)-\\delta\\) ) it follows that the net rate of returns on assets in the economy is\n\\[\nr=f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-\\delta\n\\]\nThe standard optimal consumption path that comes from the intertemporal maximization problem of the households is\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}(r-\\rho)\n\\]\nAs a result, the equilibrium is characterized by two dynamic equations (i.e., the law of motion of capital in per-capita terms and the optimal consumption path)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)} & =\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-\\delta-\\rho\\right] \\\\\n\\frac{\\dot{k}(t)}{k(t)} & =\\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-\\delta-n-\\frac{c(t)}{k(t)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nMeanwhile, the standard TVC applies, that the value of the assets (capital) is equal to zero in the end of the planning horizon\n\\[\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k(t) \\lambda(t) e^{-(\\rho-n) t}=0\n\\]",

In order to examine the properties of the BGP, examine the behavior of the \\(\\frac{c}{k}\\) ratio, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\frac{ \\dot{\\left(c(t) / k(t)\\right)}}{c(t) / k(t)}=\\frac{\\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)}-\\frac{\\dot{k}(t)}{k(t)}=\\frac{c(t)}{k(t)}+\\frac{f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-\\theta \\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-(1-\\theta) \\delta-\\theta n-\\rho}{\\theta}\n\\]\nNote that the above dynamic equation is unstable in \\(\\frac{c(t)}{k(t)}\\). Moreover, unless \\(\\frac{\\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)}=\\frac{\\dot{k}(t)}{k(t)}\\), the growth rate of \\(k(t)\\) either should cease or should increase to infinity. Both cases would violate transversality condition.

In the event of a structural change, consumption in this model makes a “discrete” shift to ensure that \\(\\frac{c(t)}{k(t)}=(\\frac{c}{k})^*\\) and the economy is set again on a BGP.\nThe steady-state growth rate of per capita consumption and capital is\n\\[\ng=\\frac{\\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)}=\\frac{\\dot{k}(t)}{k(t)}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-\\delta-\\rho\\right]\n\\]\nFurthermore, as in the Solow model, the savings rate in this economy is constant but is an endogenous object since:\n\\[\ns=\\frac{Y(t)-C(t)}{Y(t)}=1-\\frac{c^{*}}{k} \\frac{1}{\\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)}=\\frac{f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-(1-\\theta) \\delta-\\rho}{\\theta \\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)}\n\\]",

The SP’s problem is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max _{c} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{c(t)^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta} e^{-(\\rho-n) t} d t \\\\\n& \\text { s.t. } \\\\\n& \\dot{k}(t)=\\bar{A} k(t) f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-c(t)-(n+\\delta) k(t) \\\\\n& k(0)&gt;0\\text { given }\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis problem in terms of current value Hamiltonian is\n\\[\n\\max _{c} H_{S P}=\\frac{c(t)^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta}+\\lambda(t)\\left(\\bar{A} k(t) f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-c(t)-(n+\\delta) k(t)\\right) .\n\\]\nThe first order conditions (optimal rules) are\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& { c(t)^{-\\theta}=\\lambda(t) \\text {, }} \\\\\n& { \\quad \\dot{\\lambda}(t)=\\lambda (t)(\\rho-n)-\\lambda(t) \\left(\\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-(n+\\delta)\\right) \\text {. }}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\left(\\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-\\delta-\\rho\\right)\n\\]\nThe same way as in competitive equilibrium it can be argued that the capital per head grows at the same (constant) rate as the consumption. Thus,\n\\[\ng^{S P} \\equiv \\frac{\\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)}=\\frac{\\dot{k}(t)}{k(t)}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\left[\\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-\\delta-\\rho\\right]\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{c(t)}{k(t)}\\right)^{S P} \\equiv \\frac{c(t)}{k(t)}=\\frac{(1-\\theta)\\left(\\delta-\\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)\\right)-\\theta n+\\rho}{\\theta}\n\\] - The SP achieves higher growth rate because \\(\\frac{f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right) /(1 / \\bar{A})}{f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)}&gt;1\\), which holds due to the concavity of the production function. - The social marginal product of capital exceeds the private one, because the latter does not account for the efficiency benefits delivered by the overall level of capital stock in the economy. As a result, the SP saves more since \\(\\left(\\frac{c}{k}\\right)^*=\\left(\\frac{c}{k}\\right)^{S P}+\\frac{\\bar{A} f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)-f^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{A}}\\right)}{\\theta}\\), where the second term captures the gap between the social and private returns to savings. Thus, the SP achieves higher long-run growth.\n\nA growth promoting policy would try to eliminate the difference between the \\(\\left(\\frac{c}{k}\\right)^{*}=\\left(\\frac{c}{k} \\right)\\){S P}$. Since \\(\\left(\\frac{c }{k}\\right)^*&lt;\\left(\\frac{c}{k}\\right)^{S P}\\) this policy would motivate higher savings in competitive equilibrium. Therefore, a policy could be a simple subsidy to the production that equates the private return to capital to the socially optimal one and finances the subsidy through lump sum tax imposed on households .",

    "text": "9.1 Introduction\nIn contrast to the models presented so far, Lucas (1988) assumes that there are two types of assets endogenously accumulated in the economy, physical capital and human capital. The idea is very simplistic and says that in addition to producing, for instance, more infrastructure we also produce better (or more) educated workers. The better educated workers, then, produce more, while using the same amount of labor. Therefore, the labor productivity increases, and this, together with the capital accumulation, may enable long run growth.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the biggest difference between Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988) models is that the latter endogenizes the process of labor productivity growth through human capital accumulation, when the former thinks of spillover effects.\nIf presented in one sector form, the final good production side and the asset accumulation processes of Lucas (1988) model can be written as\n\\[\nY=A K^{\\alpha} H^{1-\\alpha}=C+I_{K}+I_{H}\n\\]\nwhere \\(H\\) is the human capital input, \\(I_{K}\\) and \\(I_{H}\\) are the investments for physical capital and human capital accumulation, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nI_{K} & =\\dot{K}+\\delta_{K} K \\\\\nI_{H} & =\\dot{H}+\\delta_{H} H\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta_{K}\\) is the depreciation rate physical capital and \\(\\delta_{H}\\) is the depreciation rate of human capital. Given that we consider an equilibrium where both assets are accumulated, the returns to both assets should be equal. For the current exercise let \\(\\delta_{K}=\\delta_{H} \\equiv \\delta\\). This would imply that,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial K}-\\delta & =\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial H}-\\delta \\Rightarrow \\\\\n\\alpha \\frac{Y}{K} & =(1-\\alpha) \\frac{Y}{H} \\Rightarrow \\\\\nH & =\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} K \\Rightarrow \\\\\nY & =\\left[A\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}\\right] K\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, in terms of structure, the ideas behind the Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988) models are quite similar. Both end up having an aggregate production function with non-decreasing returns to scale, and in particular linear in capital. However, Romer (1986) introduces internal spillover while Lucas (1988) considers external effects through human capital accumulation.\nThis one sector model was a simple representation of Lucas (1988). The model with corresponding assumptions is the following.",

    "text": "9.2 the Model\nThis is a two-sector model of growth, where the physical capital is still produced with the same technology as the consumption good, but human capital is produced with a different technology. Human capital is the essential input for the production of new human capital. The motivation for this is that the human capital of one generation is an important factor in affecting the formation of human capital of the later generations. If the production of human capital is within a household, that would be the human capital “embodied” in the parents. If its production is through formal education, then that would be the human capital of the teachers with their methodologies (e.g., books). The accumulation (production) of human capital \\(H\\) follows a law of motion:\n\\[\n\\dot{H}=B H_{H}-\\delta_{H} H,\n\\]\nwhere \\(H_{H}\\) is the human capital used for its own production. Every unit of human capital produces \\(B&gt;0\\) new units of human capital. This stock depreciates at a rate \\(\\delta_{H}&gt;0\\) (e.g., due to “aging” for instance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are no diminishing returns to the production of human capital with this type of production function for the human capital. The non-decreasing returns to the production of human capital will be the engine of long-run growth in this model. The increasing stock of human capital drives the accumulation of physical capital and the economy grows indefinitely. If, instead, the production of human capital had decreasing returns to its input, this model would have the same predictions as the Solow-Swan model and it would not be able explain growth in the long-run.\n\n\nThe production of final output combines physical capital stock and human capital \\(H_{Y}\\), i.e., \\(Y=A K^{\\alpha} H_{Y}^{1-\\alpha}\\), where \\(H_{Y}\\) is the human capital used in production of final good. Standard neoclassical assumptions apply.\nThe representative household chooses its consumption path, the assets (physical and human capital) in the next period and the allocation of its human capital input between final good and human capital production, in order to maximize its lifetime utility \\(U=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} u(C) e^{-\\rho t} d t\\), subject to standard budget constraint and the law of motion of human capital, where \\(u(C)=\\frac{C^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta}\\).\nDefine the fraction of human capital used in the production of final output as \\(u \\equiv \\frac{H_{Y}}{H}\\) and its complement \\(1-u=\\frac{H_H}{H}\\). There are no externalities involved in the input and output markets. By the first welfare theorem it is known that the competitive equilibrium will achieve the first-best allocations. The second welfare theorem implies that one can directly solve for the optimal allocations, as there are prices that will support the competitive equilibrium that achieves such intratemporal and intertemporal allocations.\nThe intertemporal allocation problem has two controls, consumption and allocation of human capital in the two sectors of production that compete for it. There are two state variables, human and physical capital. Physical capital accumulation requires the saving of output (consumption choices), while the human capital accumulation requires investments in terms of real resources that is to say some human capital needs to be driven out of the production of final output to produce future human capital.\nHaving in mind the welfare theorems, the representative households problem is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max _{u, C} U=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{C^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta} e^{-\\rho t} d t \\\\\n& \\text { s.t. } \\\\\n& \\dot{K}=A K^{\\alpha}(u H)^{1-\\alpha}-\\delta_{K} K-C, \\\\\n& \\dot{H}=B(1-u) H-\\delta_{H} H \\\\\n& K(0), H(0)&gt;0\\text { given. }\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet \\(\\lambda_{K}\\) and \\(\\lambda_{H}\\) be the shadow prices for the physical and human capital, respectively. The problem, if written in terms of current value Hamiltonian, is given by\n\\[\n\\max _{u, C} H_{L C}=\\frac{C^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta}+q_{K}\\left[A K^{\\alpha}(u H)^{1-\\alpha}-\\delta_{K} K-C\\right]+q_{H}\\left[B(1-u) H-\\delta_{H} H\\right]\n\\]\nThe optimal rules are\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&  \\ C^{-\\theta} & =&  \\lambda_{K} \\text {, } \\\\\n&  \\lambda_{K}(1-\\alpha) \\frac{Y}{u} & =& \\lambda_{H} B H, \\\\\n&  \\dot{\\lambda}_{K}& = & \\rho \\lambda_{K}-\\lambda_{K}\\left(\\alpha \\frac{Y}{K}-\\delta_{K}\\right) \\\\\n&   &=  & -\\lambda_{K}\\left(\\alpha \\frac{Y}{K}-\\delta_{K}-\\rho\\right), \\\\\n& \\dot{\\lambda}_{H} & = & \\rho \\lambda_{H} -\\left\\{\\lambda_{K}(1-\\alpha) \\frac{Y}{H}+\\lambda_{H}\\left[B(1-u)-\\delta_{H}\\right]\\right\\} .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9.1}\\]\nThe standard transversality conditions apply for each of the state variables:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-\\rho t} \\lambda_{K}(t) K(t)=0 \\\\\n& \\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-\\rho t} \\lambda_{H}(t) H(t)=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nUsing the first and third equations in (9.1), it follows that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{C}}{C}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\left(\\alpha \\frac{Y}{K}-\\delta_{K}-\\rho\\right)\n\\tag{9.2}\\]\nWhile from the second and fourth equations, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{\\lambda}_{H} & = \\rho\\lambda_{H} -\\left\\{\\lambda_{H} \\frac{B H}{(1-\\alpha) \\frac{Y}{u}}(1-\\alpha) \\frac{Y}{H}+\\lambda_{H}\\left[B(1-u)-\\delta_{H}\\right]\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\rho \\lambda_{H} -\\left\\{\\lambda_{H} B u+\\lambda_{H}\\left[B(1-u)-\\delta_{H}\\right]\\right\\} \\Rightarrow \\\\\n\\dot{\\lambda}_{H} & =-\\lambda_{H}\\left(B-\\delta_{H}-\\rho\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

    "text": "9.6 Further comments\nLucas motivated the importance of human capital accumulation for long-run economic growth, by forming two different (yet complementary) models. The first model allows for human capital accumulation out of the market (e.g., education sector) that would imply that there is a tradeoff between current consumption and future one, since human capital needs to be driven out of current production sector. Furthermore, in his original specification he allowed for both internal and external returns to human capital in the final-good production (spillovers à la Romer, \\(Y=\\) \\(\\left.\\left(A H^{\\gamma}\\right) K^{\\alpha} H_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} ; \\gamma&gt;0\\right)\\).\nThe second model allows on-the-job accumulation of human capital, i.e., another form of “learning-by-doing”. He assumed multiple goods, with different rates of human capital accumulation as byproduct of their production. The trade-off in this case is that human capital accumulation takes a form of a less desirable mix of current consumption goods. Growth promoting policies implied by either model are very different (education subsidies vs. industrial policy).\nThe research challenge that Lucas acknowledges himself is that human capital is not a measurable factor, and in particular its potential external effects. He proposes that a good example of the importance of external effects of human capital is the formation of cities.\nOverall, the model lacks a good justification of the non-decreasing returns to the human capital accumulation. The accumulation of human capital differs importantly from the accumulation of knowledge and therefore this model is not a model of technological progress. The important difference between them is that human capital is rival and excludable while knowledge is not rival, though can be excludable.\nEmpirically, human capital growth cannot explain cross-country growth differences. There is only some limited support that human capital matters as an input to R&D. The latter comes out an important factor in driving aggregate productivity and explaining the cross-country variation in the growth and levels of GDP per capita.",

The R&D production uses \\(L_{A}\\) amount of total labour \\(L\\). The existing set of varieties \\(A\\) increases the productivity of the \\(\\mathrm{R} \\& \\mathrm{D}\\) sector, i.e., positive knowledge externalities operate in the production of new blueprints, creating increasing returns in this sector\n\n\\[\n\\dot{A}=B A L_{A}, \\quad B&gt;0,\n\\]\nwhere \\(B\\) is the efficiency of “blueprint” creation. - An example could be the creation of wireless telephone while using the knowledge of transmitting information via radio waves and voice encoding.\n\nCapital variety producing sector that uses the blueprints and produces intermediate capital goods for the final goods production. It is characterized by monopolistic competition. There is free-entry in the market of new blueprints. Entrepreneurs compete for patent that provides them with infinite-horizon property rights on a new blueprint. The acquisition of a patent allows an entrepreneur to employ exclusively the new blueprint and produce a distinct capital good thereafter. The production of capital goods/varieties requires investment in terms of the (foregone) final good. Romer motivates the price-setting assumption by entry (fixed) costs. Each and every capital good producing firm first buys (invests) the blueprint of capital good. It then enters to capital goods market and stays there forever. In capital goods market the firm has to have strictly positive profit streams in order to recover the entry cost. To have positive profits, it has to be a price setter. Moreover, in free entry equilibrium the investment cost equals to the value derived in the market, i.e., the present value of discounted profit streams.\nFinal good production sector where producers employ \\(L_{Y}\\) amount of total labor \\(L\\) and varieties ( defined as a set) of capital goods \\(x(i), i \\in[0, A]\\) in the production, that is:\n\n\\[\nY=L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} \\int_{0}^{A} x(i)^{\\alpha} d i\n\\]\nThese firms are fully competitive in input and output markets.\nThe final good is the numeraire and may be either consumed or invested.\n\nOn the consumption-side, the representative household chooses its consumption and next period assets to maximize its lifetime utility \\(U=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} u(C) e^{-\\rho t} d t\\), subject to the standard budget constraint.\n\nWe also assume that all capital varieties depreciate fully within one period and there is no growth in population, i.e., \\(L\\) is constant.\nThe following sections develop and solve the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is the benchmark model. Two others versions show the robustness of the benchmark Romer (1990) model: the “lab-equipment” model where the final output is used to create new varieties and the “labor-for-intermediates” where labor is not embodied in the final good but is the unique input to produce the intermediate good. For sake of brevity, we redirect the reader toward Gancia and Zilibotti (2005).",

The problem of the representative final good producer is\n\\[\n\\max _{\\{x(i)\\}_{i \\in[0, A]}, L_{Y}} L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} \\int_{0}^{A} x(i)^{\\alpha} d i-\\int_{0}^{A} p_{x(i)} x(i) d i-w L_{Y}\n\\]\nThe FOC are\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&  \\quad F_{L}=\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial L_{Y}}=(1-\\alpha) \\frac{Y}{L_{Y}}=w, \\\\\n& \\quad F_{x(i)}=\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x(i)}=\\alpha L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} x(i)^{\\alpha-1}=p_{x}(i) ; \\forall i,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.1}\\]\nwhere the first expression describes the demand for labour and the second describes the demand for a capital good.\n\n\n10.3.2 Individual variety\nEach capital variety producer \\(i\\), within every period maximizes her profits \\(\\pi_{x}(i)\\), by selecting the price \\(p_{x}(i)\\) and the quantity of production \\(x(i)\\). For every unit of capital that it produces it needs to invest one unit of final good that it “borrows” from households at the current price of final output (which is set to one, i.e., the final good is the numeraire), i.e., \\(\\pi_{x}(i)=p_{x}(i) x(i)-x(i)\\). The firm takes as given the price of the output it uses in the production and the demand that it’s good is facing from the final good producers. Since the firm does not have dynamic constraints it’s problem is1\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max _{p_{x}(i), x(i)}\\left\\{\\pi_{x}(i)=p_{x}(i) x(i)-x(i)\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\text { s.t. } \\\\\n& p_{x}(i)=\\alpha L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} x(i)^{\\alpha-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe optimal rule(s) are derived by plugging the inverse demand function of capital good to the profit function and taking the derivative with respect \\(x(i)\\), i.e., solve the following problem\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\max_{x(i)} \\left\\{\\alpha L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} x(i)^{\\alpha}-x(i)\\right\\} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 1=\\alpha^{2} L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} x(i)^{\\alpha-1} \\Rightarrow x(i)=\\alpha^{\\frac{2}{1-\\alpha}} L_{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.2}\\]\nFrom (10.1) and (10.2), we derive:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{x}(i)=\\alpha L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} x^{\\alpha-1}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\Rightarrow \\\\\n& \\pi_{x}(i)=\\left[p_{x}-1\\right] x=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} \\alpha^{\\frac{2}{1-\\alpha}} L_{Y}&gt;0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10.3}\\]\nGiven the symmetry across the different varieties in the final good production (as (10.2) does not depend on index \\(i\\)), the equilibrium implies that all capital good varieties producers will make the same optimal price and quantities choices, i.e., \\(p_{x}(i)=p_{x}\\) and \\(x(i)=x \\forall i\\).\nNote that the imperfect competition in the market equilibrium implies that the price of capital good is a constant mark-up \\(\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)\\) above its marginal cost, and the quantity of supplied capital good will be lower than the one selected in a perfectly competitive market (first-best outcome). Note also that in equilibrium the final output is linear in technology since \\(Y=Y=L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} \\int_{0}^{A} x^{\\alpha} di\\) for all \\(i\\) which implies \\(Y =L_{Y}^{1-\\alpha} A x^{\\alpha}=\\alpha^{\\frac{2 \\alpha}{1-\\alpha}} L_{Y} A\\), and the economy can experience long-run growth driven by technology progress, that here takes the form of expanding variety of capital goods.\n\n\n10.3.3 Firm entry into capital goods market\nThe potential capital good producer in order to establish its firm competes with other potential producers in bidding for a new blueprint, where the blueprint is produced in fully competitive market. It makes an up-front (prior to entry) payment for the blueprint. In free entry equilibrium\nthis payment (cost of entry) is equal to the value derived by the firm in the capital market,\n\\[\nV_{x}(t)=\\int_{t}^{\\infty} \\pi_{x}(\\tau) e^{-\\int_{t}^{\\tau} r(s) d s} d \\tau\n\\tag{10.4}\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is the entry date and \\(r(s)\\) is the instantaneous real interest rate that the representative household earns on its asset holdings.\nFrom (10.4), it follows that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{V}_{x}(t) & =-\\pi_{x}(t) e^{-\\int_{t}^{t} r(s) d s}+\\int_{t}^{\\infty} \\pi_{x}(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} e^{-\\int_{t}^{\\tau} r(s) d s} d \\tau \\\\\n& =-\\pi_{x}(t)+\\int_{t}^{\\infty} \\pi_{x}(\\tau)\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[-\\int_{t}^{\\tau} r(s) d s\\right] \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\left[-\\int_{t}^{\\tau} r(s) d s\\right]} e^{-\\int_{t}^{\\tau} r(s) d s}\\right\\} d \\tau \\\\\n& =-\\pi_{x}(t)+r(t) V_{x}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich is standard Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. It can be rewritten as\n\\[\nr V_{x}=\\pi_{x}+\\dot{V}_{x}\n\\]\nIf \\(V_{x}(t)\\) is constant in equilibrium over time, then\n\\[\nV_{x}(t)=\\frac{\\pi_{x}(t)}{r(t)}\n\\]\nThis condition implies that at every point in time, the instantaneous excess of revenue over marginal cost must be just sufficient to cover the interest rate cost on the initial investment on a new blueprint. Another way of thinking this is that a household lends \\(V_{x}\\) to the entrepreneur for him to “buy” a blueprint and establish a firm and then receives in every period the “dividends” that equal to the per period profits.\nUnder the free-entry the value generated by the entry of a firm \\(V_{x}(t) \\dot{A}\\) is equal to the cost of generating the blueprint \\(w L_{A}\\),\n\\[\nV_{x}(t) \\dot{A}=w L_{A}\n\\tag{10.5}\\]\n\n\n10.3.4 The \\(R \\& D\\) sector\nAny blueprint is owned by a capital good producer which has a value \\(V_{x}(t)\\). Thus, the price/value of a “blueprint” is \\(V_{x}(t)\\) and the problem of a “blueprint” producer is\n\\[\n\\max_{L_{A}} V_{x}(t) \\underbrace{B A L_{A}}_{=\\dot{A}(t)}-w L_{A}\n\\]\nAssuming fully competitive market with free-entry and zero-profit conditions, we get from ( 10.5):\n\\[\nw(t)=V_{x}(t) B A(t)\n\\]\n\n\n10.3.5 Labour market\nThe labour market equilibrium needs to guarantee that labor is freely mobile between the final good and R&D sectors, i.e. the value of the marginal product of labour is equated in these two sectors. Therefore, the wage rate needs to be equal in both sectors:\n\\[\nw(t)=V_{x}(t) B A(t)=(1-\\alpha) \\frac{Y(t)}{L_{Y}}=\\alpha^{\\frac{2 \\alpha}{1-\\alpha}}(1-\\alpha) A(t)\n\\tag{10.6}\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nV_{x}(t)=\\frac{\\alpha^{\\frac{2 \\alpha}{1-\\alpha}}(1-\\alpha)}{B} \\equiv V_{x}\n\\]\nTherefore, indeed \\(V_{x}=\\frac{\\pi_{x}}{r}\\).\nFrom (10.3) and (10.7) it also follows that:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nw & =V_{x}(t) B A(t)=\\frac{\\pi_{x}}{r} B A(t) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} \\alpha^{\\frac{2}{1-\\alpha}} L_{Y} \\frac{1}{r} B A(t) \\frac{Y(t)}{Y(t)} \\\\\n& =\\alpha(1-\\alpha) \\frac{1}{r} B Y(t) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPlugging back this expression into (10.7), we get: \\[\nL_{Y}=\\frac{r}{\\alpha B},\\quad L_A=L-L_Y\n\\tag{10.7}\\]",

From (10.8), it follows that the interest rate should be constant on BGP and \\(g_{C} \\equiv \\frac{\\dot{C}(t)}{C(t)}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}(r-\\rho)\\). Therefore, from (10.7) it follows that \\(\\dot{L}_{Y}=0\\).\nFrom the FOCs of the intermediate capital good producers, it follows that \\(x\\) is time invariant, implying that aggregate capital stock available in the economy at every point in time \\(K=A(t) x\\) grows at rate \\(g_{K}=g_{A}\\). The economy grows due to capital-deepening which is entirely driven by the expansion of capital varieties.\nThe production function of final goods \\(Y(t)=\\alpha^{\\frac{2 \\alpha}{1-\\alpha}} L_{Y} A(t)\\) implies that along the BGP \\(g_{Y}=g_{A}\\).\nHouseholds’ total assets are \\(b(t)=V(t)A(t)\\equiv V_xA(t) \\Rightarrow \\dot{b}(t)=V_x\\dot{A}(t)\\).

By doing so, it reduces the market incentives to direct (labour) resources away from the final good production into the production of new assets/savings instruments. Along the unique BGP, these two forces are equated implying a unique real interest rate and labour allocation.

Therefore, the growth promoting policies increase the incentives to innovate by subsidies to the production of \\(R \\& D\\) (e.g., subsidies to the employment of labour in R&D) that will make the firms internalize the knowledge externalities they generate by each new variety that they discover. The distortion of the imperfect competition may be alleviated by a subsidy to the purchases of the capital goods and/ or subsidies to the production of final output that would increase the demand of capital goods. These policies would finance those subsidies by lump-sum taxes on household.",

Within each variety \\(j\\), capital goods differ in their quality.\nQualities are of distance \\(q&gt;1\\) of each other. The best quality within every sector \\(j\\) is \\(q^{\\kappa_{j}}\\), where \\(\\kappa_{j} \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}\\).

The input to the \\(\\mathrm{R} \\& \\mathrm{D}\\) production is investment in units of the final output. For the variety \\(j\\) of quality \\(\\kappa_{j}\\), the \\(\\mathrm{R} \\& \\mathrm{D}\\) expenditures are \\(Z_{j \\kappa_{j}}\\). The output of the \\(\\mathrm{R} \\& \\mathrm{D}\\) production is uncertain. The \\(\\mathrm{R} \\& \\mathrm{D}\\) expenditures result in the new variety \\(\\left(\\kappa_{j}+1\\right)\\) with probability \\(p_{j \\kappa_{j}}\\).

As the probability depends only on the current quality level, it suggests that innovation occurs like a Poisson process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLinearity implies absence of congestion. Innovation in each sector is “jumpy” (takes place in a discreet manner), however the existence of many sectors and the Law of Large Numbers ensures a smooth outcome at the aggregate level.\n\n\n\nThe discovery of a better quality capital good of a particular variety provides an entrepreneur with monopoly rights over the use of the “blueprint.” He produces the distinct capital variety with a linear technology that transforms one unit of final output into one unit of capital good.\nThere is free entry into the capital goods industry.\nThe final good sector operates under perfect competition. It combines labour, \\(L\\), with qualityadjusted input \\(\\tilde{X}_{j}\\) of every variety \\(j\\) of the existent (fixed) set of capital varieties, \\(j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}\\), i.e.,\n\n\\[\nY=A L^{1-\\alpha} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\tilde{X}_{j}^{\\alpha}\n\\]\nThere is additive separability in all varieties of capital and all of them are used in the final good production due to standard neoclassical function assumptions (Inada conditions). - Different qualities of capital goods of a variety \\(j\\) are perfect substitutes of each other. Hence, if \\(\\kappa_{j}\\) is the best quality known, the total input employed in the final good sector of the \\(j\\) th capital good variety is:\n\\[\n\\tilde{X}_{j}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\kappa_{j}} q^{k} x_{j k}\n\\] - It is assumed here that only the highest quality capital good survives of each variety of capital goods, hence\n\\[\n\\tilde{X}_{j}=q^{\\kappa_{j}} x_{j \\kappa_{j}}\n\\]\nThis “guess” regarding the properties of the equilibrium path is to be verified below, by examining the conditions that support it.\nNote: The survival of the best quality only across sectors means that the model features technological obsolescence. This results in that the decision to conduct research in order to invent a better quality capital good is based on two forces. First, the discovery is to be overtaken by another researcher in the future (this decreases incentives for research). Second, the discovery of an improved quality capital good implies that there will be a transfer of the monopoly rent from the previous best-quality discovery owner (this increases the incentives for research). - From the consumption-side, the representative HH chooses its consumption and assets to maximize its intertemporal utility: \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} u(C) e^{-\\rho t} d t\\) subject to the standard budget constraint.\n\nAll capital goods depreciate fully within one period.\nNo population growth.",

Suppose instead that this was not the case and the second-best quality is also available. The marginal product of any two consecutive qualities differs by their quality difference, i.e., by a factor of \\(q\\), which means that the price differential supported by the market equilibrium between the first and second highest quality is: \\(\\frac{P_{j \\kappa_{j}}}{P_{j \\kappa_{j}-1}}=q\\). Therefore, the monopoly producer of the second highest quality can at most charge \\(P_{j \\kappa_{j}-1}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha q}\\). If \\(\\alpha q&gt;1\\), then the second best quality producer cannot cover with such price its marginal cost of production and is driven out of the market. Alternatively, if \\(\\alpha q&lt;1\\), the result that only the leading technology survives within each variety can still be an equilibrium outcome, where the leader follows limit pricing. In such case it charges \\(P_{j} \\kappa_{j}=q-\\varepsilon\\) \\((\\varepsilon \\rightarrow+0)\\) and the next quality producer then could charge \\(1-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{q}&lt;1\\). :::\nWith the leading technology only, then the final output production in equilibrium is described by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY & =A L^{1-\\alpha} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} q^{\\alpha \\kappa_{j}} x_{j \\kappa_{j}}^{\\alpha} \\\\\n& =L A^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}} \\alpha^{\\frac{2 \\alpha}{1-\\alpha}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} q^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\kappa_{j}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n11.3.3 the \\(R\\& D\\) Sector\nGiven the equilibrium outcome of the capital goods, labour and final output market, the next step is to examine the decision of the entrepreneurs to conduct \\(\\mathrm{R} \\& \\mathrm{D}\\) for the discovery of the \\(\\kappa_{j+1}\\) quality of every type of capital good. Access to the market is free, therefore, every entrepreneur should be in the limit equating his cost in investing in \\(\\mathrm{R} \\& \\mathrm{D}\\) with his expected profit.\nThe cost of \\(\\mathrm{R} \\& \\mathrm{D}\\) is the investment in terms of current output, \\(Z_{j \\kappa_{j}}\\). The probability of a successful innovation of the quality \\(\\kappa_{j}+1\\) is \\(p_{j \\kappa_{j}}\\) while the expected value from it is \\(V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\). More rigorously, \\(V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\) is the expected present value of the profit flows of the producer of \\(\\kappa_{j}+1\\), which within every period is \\(\\pi_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} x_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\), until its position is overtaken by the discovery of the next quality of the same type of capital good. The latter depends on the probability of the discovery of the next higher quality, \\(p_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\). Therefore, the successful innovator of the \\(\\kappa_{j}+1\\) quality has \\(V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\) that satisfies in equilibrium:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1} & =\\pi_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}-p_{j \\kappa_{j}+1} V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1} \\\\\n& \\Longrightarrow V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}=\\frac{\\pi_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}}{r+p_{j \\kappa_{j+1}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{11.2}\\]\nThe last condition is essentially an arbitrage condition. The entrepreneur should be indifferent between lending \\(V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\) units of output and earning the market interest rate, i.e. \\(r V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\) and holding the firm that provides him with a profit flow, \\(\\pi_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\), and there is a probability that at the end of the period he loses the value of its firm because it is overtaken by a new higher quality product (i.e., its capital loss will be \\(-V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}\\) ).\nTherefore, given that there is free entry into capital goods sector in equilibrium\n\\[\np_{j \\kappa_{j}} V_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}=Z_{j \\kappa_{j}}\n\\]\nFrom this condition and the \\(R \\& D\\) production function (11.1) together with (11.2) it follows that\n\\[\np_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}=\\phi\\left(\\kappa_{j}\\right) \\pi_{j \\kappa_{j}+1}-r\n\\]\nTherefore, the equilibrium probability of a new innovation is influenced by two forces\n\nA higher quality of a type of capital variety implies higher demand for this type of capital and thereby higher profits for the successful innovator.\nThe marginal cost of discovering a higher quality capital variety increases.\n\nWhen the positive effect dominates, newer sectors grow faster than older ones, i.e. there are increasing returns to scale. When the negative effect dominates there is convergence to à la Ramsey. When the two effects balance each other out (i.e. when there are CRS), there is balanced growth in all sectors.",

    "text": "11.5 Further comments\nThe decentralized equilibrium in this model does not achieve first best allocations due to the following distortions\n\nMonopoly pricing in the capital goods sector,\nObsolescence of the lower quality capital goods.\n\nThe first distortion implies that there is low investment and growth in the economy. The second implies that when a new innovation is made, then the successful innovator takes over the profits made by the previous leader in the particular type of capital variety. This “rat race” effect boosts the incentive to conduct \\(R \\& D\\) for the purpose of product innovation. At the same time though, for the same potential innovator there is positive probability that himself will be overtaken by the next discovery, which reduces the incentives for R&D. Because of discounting, as current profits matter more than future ones, the outcome is that in equilibrium there is more than optimal \\(R \\& D\\) investment, which would tend to increase growth. The net effect of the two distortions is ambiguous.\nThe decentralized growth rate will be equal to the social planner’s one when relative prices are corrected and the successful innovators compensate their immediate predecessors for the loss of their monopoly rents. In the case that all innovations are conducted by the leaders in each sector, i.e. when there is no need for compensation, equilibrium \\(R \\& D\\) would be too low. If instead relative prices are corrected, but no compensation is offered, then \\(R \\& D\\) would be too high.\nContrast with Romer (1990) The horizontal expansion in the capital good varieties model may be better suited for large-scale inventions (e.g. the ones implying the establishment of a new industry). The vertical expansion of every variety of capital goods is better suited to account for the smaller and gradual improvements in the quality of the capital goods.\nOn the one hand, both of these endogenous growth models share key features and thereby predictions. In both models, the production-side equilibrium implies that the interest rate has a negative growth effect as it reduces the present discounted value of the expected profits from innovations. Also, both models “suffer” from scale-effects. The engine of long-run growth is the R&D production that is conducted given market-based incentives. Noteworthy, the organizational capital/institutional level of the economy, as captured by the term \\(A\\) in the aggregate production function, has not only a level effect (as in Solow), but a permanent growth effect.\nOn the other hand, there are important differences in their specifications. Romer’s model lacks the feature of creative destruction as it assumes that the different varieties are not direct substitutes or complements. As a result, in the decentralized equilibrium the R&D effort cannot be too high.",
